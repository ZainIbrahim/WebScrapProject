Why do some states have strong civil societies and others do not? Is there a long-term trend towards democracy? Students will explore such questions by looking at the different paths of political development taken by individual states. The question of which form of government best serves the needs of modern nations is important both for the states themselves and for the international community, especially Australia.","Adopting a thematic approach this unit presents a survey history of Australia in the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. It examines major events, individuals and circumstances that have shaped modern Australia, including cultural achievements, scientific discoveries, economic booms and depressions, arbitration, the trade union movement, race relations, immigration, political scandals and wars - real or imagined. Students will learn how history texts of the past are challenged by fresh perspectives on what is significant and relevant in Australia's history, and they will be encouraged to reflect on the relationship between changing social values and ways in which we understand the past.","This unit explores nation-making in Australia, Europe and the Middle East through a variety of social and cultural lenses. Students examine relationships between nationalism and other key political, social and cultural issues including war, music, landscape, religion, gender, sport and national days. Students are positioned to undertake individual research projects to develop reflective understandings of doing History.","This unit examines Australians and their involvement in wars from 1788 to the present. Themes include: fear of invasion; Australia's role in the British Empire and as American ally; the cost of war; modern warfare, including peacekeeping; the impact of war on the Australian national psyche (attitudes to particular racial groups, and to people who did not serve in wars; and exclusion of women from the ANZAC legend). Historical debates will include whether the Frontier Wars should be commemorated alongside Australia's service in overseas wars; whether there was a 'battle for Australia' in 1942, Australians in the Vietnam War, and the rationale for Australia's present military engagements.","This unit equips students with the skills to complete their own local history project. Through detailed practical application of Historian’s skills, students engage and reflect on historical practice in oral history, archival research and the interpretation of primary sources. The unit offers students an opportunity to reflect on the theoretical frameworks regularly used by historians as well as on their own practice as creators of history.","The unit addresses the political and social history of the post 1945 period with an emphasis on the origins and legacies of the Cold War. We consider how notions of ‘cooperation’, ‘competition’ and ‘conflict’ can be understood in a variety of ways and how historical interpretations of the past can vary over time and place. Topics covered may include: War in Korea and Vietnam, McCarthyism in the US, Russia and the end of the Cold War, the establishment of NATO, The Israel Palestine Conflict, The War on Terror, Peace Movements and the campaign for denuclearisation.","This unit explores general ideas and critical concepts that form the foundations of cultural studies. The unit develops ideas about culture, texts, and modes of power and production. The unit aims to expand student understandings of the complex and interwoven operation of culture through examining a variety of texts through historical and social disciplinary lenses."

					","This unit is an introduction to methods of statistical analysis and their role in scientific inference - drawing conclusions about the world using data. It begins with an introduction to probability, which provides a foundation for understanding randomness, uncertainty, chance, and most important of all, for statistical inference. We start with a gentle introduction to definitions of probability and probability models, and then go on to discuss probability distributions, and tools and techniques that can be used to model a wide range of phenomena, as well as those that are useful in statistical inference. In the second part of the unit, we discuss descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Throughout, we will emphasize that how data are collected determines the nature of the conclusions that we are entitled to draw from any study. Students will be introduced to the R language statistical environment, which they will use for exploring, displaying, and analysing data, and for carrying out and reporting the results of statistical inference.","This unit is designed to prepare pre-service teachers to teach the Senior Secondary Mathematics curriculum. The focus of the unit is on curriculum planning, teaching strategies, assessment, reporting, the demonstration of positive impact on student learning and research relating to Senior Secondary Mathematics. The unit examines moderation, the provision of feedback and responding to individual student needs.","This unit will consider problems arising in business and industry. The students will learn the necessary skills to model and solve such problems through network optimisation. The topics covered include: Applied Graph Theory (basic definitions; applications of graph theory to network design and analysis; scheduling; facility layout design; various allocation and routing problems), Network Flows (basic concepts; application; Max- flow Min-cut Theorem; feasible flows and algorithms), Matchings (basic concepts; applications; algorithm for maximum matchings in bipartite graphs), Project Management (project planning; resource allocation problems; time constraints).","This unit introduces some fundamental theories and methods for the solution of differential equations and multivariable integral and vector calculus problems. It aims for students to develop their mathematical skills for modelling and solving real world problems by using differential equations and multivariable calculus. Topics covered include first-order differential equations, second and higher order constant coefficient linear equations, power series solutions, Fourier series, partial differential equations, gradient and directional derivatives, maxima and minima, double and triple integrals, line and surface integrals, div and curl, path independence, Green’s theorem, divergence theorem and Stokes theorem.",The focus of this unit is on building on previous knowledge to further understand the characteristics of adolescent development that impact teaching and learning in a classroom setting. This examination will lead to the development of pedagogical strategies designed to maximise the outcomes of a diverse range of adolescent learners. On completion of this unit students will have developed a portfolio of practical strategies and professional resources upon which to draw when they are educating adolescents.,"This unit introduces the fundamental techniques and methods for solving real world problems by building mathematical models and fosters a deeper understanding of the use of mathematics in science and engineering disciplines. Topics covered include Newton’s laws and their applications, suffix notation and tensor operations, stress equations of motion, rate of strain tensors and constitutive equations, mathematical modelling of heat transfer and fluid flows, solutions of partial differential equation models in biology, engineering and science, diffusion, water filtration and traffic flow.","This unit broadly covers topics in Complex Analysis, Laplace Transforms, Special and Generalised Functions, and Second order ordinary differential equations with symmetry properties. In Complex Analysis we discover that the Complex Number Field is in some sense a natural completion of the Real Number Field, with Laurent Series the natural extension of Taylor Series, and Residue Theory giving us exciting new methods of integration.  Laplace Transforms give us a method of reducing a differential equation to an algebraic problem. Special functions are functions that are written in terms of integrals. The ones considered, the Gamma funcion and Error function, turn up in statistics. Generalised functions, only really make sense under an integral sign. The ones we consider, including the Dirac delta, Unit step and signum functions arise naturally in work with Laplace Transforms. Second order differential equations with certain symmetry properties, namely homogeneous Sturm-Liouville systems, have properties analagous to eigenvalue problems involving symmetric matrices. Their study gives rise to orthogonal complete sets of functions on an interval, such as Fourier Series (seen in Advanced Calculus), Legendre Polynomials, and Bessel Functions. Finally we see how to construct Green's Functions that are used to solve non-homogeneous Sturm-Liouville systems.",

An exploration of the historical pattern of thought will illustrate that chemistry is both testable and contestable and that theories may be limited by or to certain conditions. Physical and chemical properties of molecules, such as polarity, intermolecular forces, colour and magnetism, will illustrate how a fundamental understanding of atomic theory can explain macroscopic observations. Energy is the interconvertible capacity to do work, however not all energy can be converted into work and is usually transferred in the form of heat. Heat transfer can be measured in some reactions to predict the heat transfer in other reactions. Electrochemical processes can be utilised to provide energy in the form of electricity without many of the limitations of other energy production systems. Applications of electrochemical energy conversion will be investigated. The purpose and limitations of chemical measurement will be explored by highlighting its role in everyday life and the breadth of techniques, methodologies and instruments available to perform analyses of relevant species.",,,,,,,,,"This unit is designed to prepare pre-service Lower Secondary Science teachers.

Geometric properties (Area, Centroid, I, Z, S) are determined in order to calculate normal and shear stresses due to applied Axial, Bending, Shear and Torsion actions. Material properties (E, G, Poisson’s Ratio) are examined and utilised in order to determine normal and shear strains due to normal and shear stresses. The basic relationships between normal stress and strain are expanded upon with the investigation into general beam equations, general strain equations, compatibility, composite beam behaviour and plastic behaviour of beams. Shear stresses and strains due to shear forces and torsion in circular shafts are introduced. Biaxial Stress systems, and the combination of normal and shear stresses, are analysed using Mohr’s circles of stress and strain, and stress transformation equations. Combined stresses due to combined loadings complete the stress and strain analysis component of the unit.","The unit is on the analysis of stresses in structural elements for different types of actions.
