Students are introduced to the discipline through: engagement with the nature and role of theory; addressing the alternative and complementary perspectives through which we can understand processes of systemic continuity and change in global relationships; considering the machinery of global interaction; and, through discerning thematic trends in the world’s affairs.","This unit constructs a space for the analysis of the cultures out of which low intensity conflicts are born, without which understandings of the wars of nation states, and the issues of sustainable development and national security can only be partially understood. It reconfigures traditional conceptualisations of “war” as an anthropology of small-scale conflicts, interrogating the cultures of violence which overwhelm communities. Ethnographic and historical analyses are deployed to understand displacement, the social logics of violence, the stresses of modernisation, globalisation and contested power relationships. Research-based case studies are used to examine the meanings of war and conflict which reach deep into the social and cultural fabric of the nation state. The unit focuses on an inter-disciplinary approach to national security, sustainable development and international relations.","This unit introduces and analyses the international relations of the Asia-Pacific region.  It examines the determinants of conflict and cooperation in the Cold War and post-Cold War periods amongst three of the world’s largest economies - the United States, China and Japan - as well as the intense competition and conflict between the superpowers - the United States and the Soviet Union.  Competing explanations for key security issues in the Asia Pacific region are also assessed.","This unit examines the conceptual framework of contemporary strategy formulation, especially in the context of accessing and securing traditional and alternative energy resources.  Students will engage in the critical analysis of contemporary and future security challenges that may affect the supplies of energy as well as pricing of key energy commodities.  Problems of transferring dual-use technologies such as issues concerning nuclear technology transfer and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are also analysed.  Geo-political problems and challenges associated with exploration and extraction of energy resources and their transfer to consumers are also analysed, including future strategies for governments and private business based on critical international risk assessment.",,,,,,

This unit positions students to use and develop their knowledge so they, too, can 'do' - rather than just 'read' - anthropology or sociology. In doing so, students deploy observation and interviewing methods to examine small, particular aspects of the cultures of everyday life.","This unit examines contemporary theory and practice in anthropology and sociology, specifically in the anthropology and sociology of public problems. These focus on the construction of a public problem and its conversion from private concern to public issue. Public problems can range from concerns over the global economic recession, climate change and terrorism to those of obesity, cigarette smoking, town planning or graffiti. Students will consider several research projects in order to develop a reflexive awareness of contemporary anthropological and sociological practices and methods. This unit also involves undertaking a project which may be textually based and/or involve the collection and analysis of empirical materials.","Students in this unit learn and engage with methodological approaches to projects in fields of media, creative arts and social inquiry to develop their critical and creative capacity for conceiving a project that would be significant to their studies, career or community engagement. Through three-hour weekly seminars and preparatory tasks, students explore a variety of topics, questions and methodological approaches to understand how research, critical and creative practices can be combined in the production of a project, exegesis or thesis that responds to a significant concern. The seminars will introduce students to a range of contemporary research issues from Indigenous Peoples’ rights, cultural and technological change, effective communication and engagement with community or industry networks. Through seminar activities and assessment tasks, students conceptualize, test and refine a central question for their project and evaluate methodological approaches that would enable them to answer the question.",Narratives underpin a range of cultural artefacts. This unit explores key elements of narrative construction such as story and narration; time and space; narrating perspective and voice. It also examines the ways in which their elements function in relation to audiences and their social contexts.,"Through this unit, students will learn how to work with academic supervision in planning and designing a feasible research project within their chosen discipline. Through workshops, students will explore practices of project planning, proposal and grant writing, independent supervised research and research ethics. They will arrange and participate in meetings with a disciplinary scholar in developing their plan for a feasible project to be implemented in subsequent study periods, and are expected to address the advice of this scholar in drafting their project proposal. Towards the end of semester, students will submit a formal Research Project Proposal which describes how their postgraduate research project would be implemented. They will also reflect on the ethical dimensions of this project in relation to the university’s ethics approval processes.","The second of two supervised independent Master project units involving detailed research in/of a subject to be chosen in consultation with the relevant discipline supervisor. This unit focuses on the completion and presentation of the research commenced in MEDA6005 Advanced Discipline Project 1, and will be taken in the semester following or at the same time as that unit. The specific nature of the project, the methods of research and the outcomes in terms of reports, publications or presentations will be determined on an individual basis for each student and may include professionally orientated tasks or components.","Students complete a supervised independent project individually or in collaboration with other students in a discipline or across disciplines approved by their supervisor. This postgraduate project is a work of creative or professional practice or a combination of these practices, and is expected to become a significant element in the student’s portfolio. Students are advised to undertake a project that is significant to their ongoing studies, career or community engagement.","This unit embarks on a chronological journey through forms of modern literary and popular narrative from the early-nineteenth century to the present time. It looks at the narrative genres of realism and gothicism and how they interact and change, often drawing from their generic “opposite”. Diverse narrative forms are analysed, including novels and films.","This unit explores the anthropology and sociology of cities and cultural life within them. It deals with such topics as the origins and growth of cities, kinship, family and neighbourhood in urban contexts, work and recreation in cities, class, ethnicity and gender in urban life, the role of different senses in the experience of city life and ethnographic studies in and of urban settings. The guiding theoretical notions for this unit are governance, community, senses and resistance.","This unit explores general ideas and critical concepts that form the foundations of cultural studies. The unit develops ideas about culture, texts, and modes of power and production. The unit aims to expand student understandings of the complex and interwoven operation of culture through examining a variety of texts through historical and social disciplinary lenses."

Lectures will cover electrical, electromagnetic and acoustic properties of soils, rocks and groundwater. They will also cover application of geophysical methods for groundwater management in a range of industrial and environmental settings such as; mining, agriculture, water supply, managed aquifer recharge and management of the saline water interfaces along coastal margins. Attention will be given to electromagnetic (airborne, surface and downhole), ground penetrating radar (GPR), radiometric, shallow seismic and magnetic surveying for environmental applications. Particular attention will be given to linking geophysics with modern hydraulic flow and solute transport modelling.","In this unit you will apply skills learned in previous courses to a ""real world"" mineral exploration setting by carrying out a range of geophysical survey methods at a remote project area, and by writing an industry standard report summarising the project background, problems addressed, methods applied in the field, data processing - analysis - interpretation methodology and final outcomes.","Introduce students to advanced techniques and exploration practice in geophysical processing and interpretation; seismic data processing, use of commercial geophysical packages (such as PROMAX, Geosoft, Encom, ER Mapper and/or Intrepid) to process and interpret geophysical data sets. Lectures will take the form of pre-laboratory sessions and cover the necessary theory for the laboratory exercises.","Electromagnetic (EM): Basic principles; description of frequency and time domain EM systems; magnetotellurics (MT) and CSAMT, system characteristics and response forms; field configurations, modelling and interpretation techniques; applications and geoelectrical considerations.","The main aim of the unit is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the process of seismic data acquisition for both onshore and offshore situations. These two environments are significantly different and accordingly require implementations of specialised technologies, different acquisition geometries and strategies and even different data processing and analysis algorithms. Consequently, the course is divided into two main parts: land and marine seismic data acquisition. Land seismic lectures elaborate on the two-dimensional (2D) seismic data acquisition techniques, including survey design, selection of recording parameter and implementation of various acquisition geometries. Land data acquisition then expands into more complex three-dimensional (3D) space. Optimisation of the 3D geometry is the key to successful implementation of the reflection seismic method for exploration of oil, gas and minerals. Our department operates a state-of-the-art land seismic data acquisition equipment. The marine seismic part of the course is typically conducted by top industry scientists due to very complex and fast evolving methodologies and instrumentation utilised in marine seismic surveys. Students are fully exposed to the latest developments in the seismic data acquisition sector, including novel instrumentation and acquisition strategies for both onshore and offshore surveys.",Seismic waves in a homogenous medium. Plane and spherical waves. Evanescent plane waves. Boundary conditions. Zeoppritz equations. Principles of Amplitude versus offset (AVO) analysis. AVO approximations. AVO classes. Seismic Anisotropy. Land seismic data processing. AVO analysis for detection of gas accumulations. Seismic Inversion for porosity mapping and hydrocarbon search.
