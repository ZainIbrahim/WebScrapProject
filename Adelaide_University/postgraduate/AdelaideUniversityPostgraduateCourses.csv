Clearly developing a project management plan does not necessarily guarantee project success for the project manager. Project governance and contracting decision making need to be aligned with the organisation's  governance model across the entire project lifecycle and therefore is a critical element of any project. This course develops the competencies for establishing and maintaining an effective project governance framework that enables and informs effective project decision making. It covers the key project governance and contract principles, in support of the 'prudency' and 'efficiency' of the capital spend for all linear type projects.","This course explores a variety of understandings and methods of undertaking and delivering `research'. Research is understood as the organised activity of focused observation, recording, analysis and documented communication of a determined point of investigation.

The studio project will engage with cultural, historical, political, social, technical, environmental and civil contexts to develop contemporary  designs.","This is a studio interrogating theories and practices of urban design. Students are to develop an urban design project demonstrating understanding of the interconnected variety of technical, social and cultural influences upon development of projects considered at the scale of the city. Projects may be located within, but are not limited to, Adelaide. Following examinations of a chosen site, students identify and pursue their own project in response to site-specific issues. These are compared against issues of international significance, treating the specific context as a laboratory for testing ideas against understandings of global urban conditions, infrastructure and city development.","This studio provides opportunities for exploration of themes in contemporary landscape architecture including interrelationships with planning, ecology and infrastructure. The themes and sites will be ambitious in scale, including urban parks, post-industrial or urban renewal projects, consistent with effective consideration of the scale of ecological systems and the influence of planning policy. Models and digital modelling are typically emphasized in this studio. Students will also be introduced to extracting data using GIS software.  Students will develop advanced integrated design strategies through site investigations, case studies and theoretical speculation.

The agri-food system has evolved from producing and selling primarily homogeneous agricultural commodities to focusing more on value-adding, differentiation and coordination with other firms in the food chain. In order to remain competitive, some agribusiness firms are developing more of a marketing orientation, focusing increasingly on product development to meet heterogeneous consumer preferences and distinct market segments. The dynamic and increasingly global nature of food systems increases the need for sophisticated skills in market analysis, market planning and marketing management. This course approaches global food and agricultural marketing from a managerial perspective. It introduces the basic concepts in economic and marketing theories and place them in the unique context of food and agricultural production, processing, distribution, wholesaling and retailing, where discussion of markets are integrated with business marketing principles and strategy. Students will gain an understanding of the unique and changing structural, institutional, organizational and political aspects of food chains, as well as the fundamental economic theories and concepts necessary for analysis of global food and agricultural markets.","In this course, we will examine the interconnections between development, growth, agriculture and globalisation, the role of agriculture in economic development and structural transformation. Topics include economic growth, economic development, inequality, inequity, poverty and how they are measured. We will study these topics using emerging economies as case studies. We will talk about BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) what characterises their economic development, and their role in international food and trade systems.

The agri-food system has evolved from producing and selling primarily homogeneous agricultural commodities to focusing more on value-adding, differentiation and coordination with other firms in the food chain. In order to remain competitive, some agribusiness firms are developing more of a marketing orientation, focusing increasingly on product development to meet heterogeneous consumer preferences and distinct market segments.

Although it may be exciting to think of leadership as inspiration, decisive action, and powerful rewards, leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disturbing the status quo, and working with organizational and political conflicts. Those who choose to lead take the risks and sometimes are neutralized for doing so."" Ronald A Heifitz

An essential skill of leadership in our time is the ability to work with people to tackle challenges and changes which are not only technical in nature but which require people (including ourselves) to change. In Fundamentals of Leadership, we will identify the challenges of leadership in the second decade of the 21st Century. We will explore habitual responses to many modern challenges and identify why they often do not work (John Kotter, a leading scholar on Change suggests that around 75% of change initiatives fail). We will explore other responses and use the classroom to help us to understand the role of culture, systems, authority and leadership in people-based change.

Positioned at the beginning of the MBA, Fundamentals of Leadership encourages you to think about the nature of what you will study over the whole Program. It also encourages you to explore and develop personal skills central to leadership.  By exploring self-awareness, and developing a personal leadership philosophy students will be well placed to broaden their understanding of other individuals and social groups at work.","Many of today's complex challenges cannot be tackled with the narrowly-focused, unconnected thinking of the past.  Managers must make decisions and take action in complex environments in which finance, economics, markets, people and nature are interconnected and interdependent.  In addition, this `messy? interconnectedness blurs the boundaries between organisations, communities and fields of expertise ? nothing is neat and tidy.  This course will introduce you to the world of systems and systems thinking.  We will consider the merits of looking at wholes, rather than unconnected parts, and we will explore ways in which managers can make use of the nature of systems, even in complex, unpredictable environments, to influence outcomes in a more profound way than can be achieved with `linear? or `mechanistic? thinking",,,,,,,,,"1, Distinguish between ‘authority’ and ‘adaptive leadership’, identify examples of ‘authority’ and ‘adaptive leadership’ and reflect on their relative effectiveness in specific contexts, 2, Identify, diagnose and analyse complicated and complex systems in the workplace and shift analytical focus from individuals towards these systems as well as separate the processes of observation and interpretation and resist quick interpretations leading to misguided actions, 3,   Undertake a process of personal transformation through the development of a wide array of leadership skills, 4, Propose ‘safe-to-fail’ experiments designed to help understand systems, themselves, and others and guide the way towards more effective leadership, 5, Gain and develop insights on self and others in a workplace context and ask deep, probing questions and provide courageous feedback to colleagues that helps them to learn, 6, Identify, source, evaluate, interpret and analyse both primary and secondary data to inform small scale research task","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1-6, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 1,2,5, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 1-6, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 1,5, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 1-6, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , 1-6",,,,,,,,

The agri-food system has evolved from producing and selling primarily homogeneous agricultural commodities to focusing more on value-adding, differentiation and coordination with other firms in the food chain. In order to remain competitive, some agribusiness firms are developing more of a marketing orientation, focusing increasingly on product development to meet heterogeneous consumer preferences and distinct market segments. The dynamic and increasingly global nature of food systems increases the need for sophisticated skills in market analysis, market planning and marketing management. This course approaches global food and agricultural marketing from a managerial perspective. It introduces the basic concepts in economic and marketing theories and place them in the unique context of food and agricultural production, processing, distribution, wholesaling and retailing, where discussion of markets are integrated with business marketing principles and strategy. Students will gain an understanding of the unique and changing structural, institutional, organizational and political aspects of food chains, as well as the fundamental economic theories and concepts necessary for analysis of global food and agricultural markets.","This course is designed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge of research principles and the steps required to proposition examinations of real-world food and / or agricultural business problems, issues or strategic opportunities.

Understanding financial accounting information is critical for a wide range of business decision making. Being able to ask for and understand the appropriate financial information is particularly important for financial analysts and individuals seeking, or already in, management positions at all levels of organizations. 

Financial statement analysis is exciting and dynamic. It can be orientated in different ways to suit the needs of many individuals including investors, analysts, consultants, creditors, managers, directors, regulators and employees. This offering of Financial Statement Analysis has been specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals who have sufficient background in accounting and finance. The course forges a unique path in financial statement analysis that responds to the needs of modern day business analysts. In particular, it provides a framework for using financial statement data in a variety of business analysis and valuation context.

The most important knowledge and skill for managers attempting to understand financial statement information, is a good knowledge of how important business transactions are accounted for, and how these transactions appear in the financial statements. It will be much harder for informed managers to be confused and mislead by 'creative' financial reporting put before them by others. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching managers and business analysts the skills to be able to understand the complexities of financial statements, and untangle important information that is not visible to the untrained eye. 

The pedagogy adopted for this course is deliberately designed to closely follow the set text, and the range of applied questions provided in the text. The reason for this approach is very simple: to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to understand financial reporting techniques and pitfalls requires a practice more than anything else. The set tutorials and assignments will engage you in tasks that are designed to provide you with this practice. It is very important that you do each and every one of the set work tasks to the best of your ability to obtain the most from the course.",,,,,,,,,"Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 2,4, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 5, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 4, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 5, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , 1-5","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , All, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , All, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , All, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , All, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , All, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , All",,,,,,,,

Understanding financial accounting information is critical for a wide range of business decision making. Being able to ask for and understand the appropriate financial information is particularly important for financial analysts and individuals seeking, or already in, management positions at all levels of organizations. 

Financial statement analysis is exciting and dynamic. It can be orientated in different ways to suit the needs of many individuals including investors, analysts, consultants, creditors, managers, directors, regulators and employees. This offering of Financial Statement Analysis has been specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals who have sufficient background in accounting and finance. The course forges a unique path in financial statement analysis that responds to the needs of modern day business analysts. In particular, it provides a framework for using financial statement data in a variety of business analysis and valuation context.

The most important knowledge and skill for managers attempting to understand financial statement information, is a good knowledge of how important business transactions are accounted for, and how these transactions appear in the financial statements. It will be much harder for informed managers to be confused and mislead by 'creative' financial reporting put before them by others. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching managers and business analysts the skills to be able to understand the complexities of financial statements, and untangle important information that is not visible to the untrained eye. 

The pedagogy adopted for this course is deliberately designed to closely follow the set text, and the range of applied questions provided in the text. The reason for this approach is very simple: to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to understand financial reporting techniques and pitfalls requires a practice more than anything else. The set tutorials and assignments will engage you in tasks that are designed to provide you with this practice. It is very important that you do each and every one of the set work tasks to the best of your ability to obtain the most from the course.",,,,,,,,"Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 2, 3 and 4, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 3 and 4, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 3 and 4, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 4, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , None","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1-4, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 1-4, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 1-4, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 1,2, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 1,2","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , All, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , All, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , All, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , All, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , All, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , All",,,,,,,

The agri-food system has evolved from producing and selling primarily homogeneous agricultural commodities to focusing more on value-adding, differentiation and coordination with other firms in the food chain. In order to remain competitive, some agribusiness firms are developing more of a marketing orientation, focusing increasingly on product development to meet heterogeneous consumer preferences and distinct market segments. The dynamic and increasingly global nature of food systems increases the need for sophisticated skills in market analysis, market planning and marketing management. This course approaches global food and agricultural marketing from a managerial perspective. It introduces the basic concepts in economic and marketing theories and place them in the unique context of food and agricultural production, processing, distribution, wholesaling and retailing, where discussion of markets are integrated with business marketing principles and strategy. Students will gain an understanding of the unique and changing structural, institutional, organizational and political aspects of food chains, as well as the fundamental economic theories and concepts necessary for analysis of global food and agricultural markets.","In this course, we will examine the interconnections between development, growth, agriculture and globalisation, the role of agriculture in economic development and structural transformation.
