The focus of the course is on students learning how to do research in Psychology, with an emphasis on student-centred activities and problem solving. Students will learn about such key concepts as the scientific method;
operationalizing constructs; independent and dependent variables; data types and ways of measurement; confounding variables; experimental and non-experimental design; questionnaire construction; developing and testing hypotheses; descriptive statistics and describing data graphically; and the ethics of research.","Every day we make decisions that guide our behaviour by relying on our tacit knowledge about the world. We form impressions and make predictions based on personal experience. But our cognitive architecture leaves us ill-equipped to deal with random and unusual events, and the probabilistic inferences we make about the world with imperfect data are often wrong. With mass media and vast datasets now at our fingertips online, sound scientific and statistical thinking has never been more important for evaluating claims made with data. The goal of this capstone course is to challenge you to think critically about research methods in psychology, bringing together and extending what you've learned about research design and statistics. We will apply scientific and statistical concepts like regression to the mean, the law of large and small numbers, correlation, causation, replication, generality, fidelity, and control, to a variety of real-world questions. We will discuss classic and contemporary meta-science problems, open science practices, and how the credibility revolution is changing the way we do and evaluate research in psychology. You will put all of this into practice by critically evaluating popular psychological claims, presenting your principled arguments to your peers, and critically reflecting on thorny methodological problems. The emphasis in this course is on when and why particular methods and statistical tools might be applied, and how to formulate a principled argument for what they can (and can't) tell us.",,,,,,,,,"Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 1, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 1, 6, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1,2,3,4,5, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 1,3,5, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 3, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , 1,2,4,5, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , 1,2,4,5",,,,,,,,

This course helps students develop the understanding that they will need to make informed decisions using data, and to communicate the results effectively. The course is an introduction to the essential concepts, tools and methods of statistics for students in business, economics and similar disciplines, although it may have wider interest.  The focus is on concepts, reasoning, interpretation and thinking rather than computation, formulae and theory.  Much of the work will require students to write effectively and communicate their ideas with clarity. The course covers two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.  Descriptive statistics includes collecting data and summarising and interpreting them through numerical and graphical techniques.  Inferential statistics includes selecting and applying the correct statistical technique in order to make estimates or test claims about a population based on a sample.  Topics covered may include descriptive statistics, correlation and simple regression, probability, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple regression, time series analysis and index numbers.  

By the end of this course, students should understand and know how to use statistics.  Students will also develop some understanding of the limitations of statistical inference and of the ethics of data analysis and statistics.  Students will work in small groups in this course; this will develop the skills required to work effectively and inclusively in groups, as in a real work environment.  Typically, one component of the assessment requires students to work in teams and collect and analyse data in order to answer a real-world problem of their own choosing.","This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the principles of Marketing.

This course helps students develop the understanding that they will need to make informed decisions using data, and to communicate the results effectively. The course is an introduction to the essential concepts, tools and methods of statistics for students in business, economics and similar disciplines, although it may have wider interest.  The focus is on concepts, reasoning, interpretation and thinking rather than computation, formulae and theory.  Much of the work will require students to write effectively and communicate their ideas with clarity. The course covers two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.  Descriptive statistics includes collecting data and summarising and interpreting them through numerical and graphical techniques.  Inferential statistics includes selecting and applying the correct statistical technique in order to make estimates or test claims about a population based on a sample.  Topics covered may include descriptive statistics, correlation and simple regression, probability, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple regression, time series analysis and index numbers.  

By the end of this course, students should understand and know how to use statistics.  Students will also develop some understanding of the limitations of statistical inference and of the ethics of data analysis and statistics.  Students will work in small groups in this course; this will develop the skills required to work effectively and inclusively in groups, as in a real work environment.  Typically, one component of the assessment requires students to work in teams and collect and analyse data in order to answer a real-world problem of their own choosing.","This course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the principles of Marketing.

It considers both microeconomics - the analysis of choices made by individual decision-making units (households and firms) - and macroeconomics - the analysis of the economy as a whole.  The use of a market, supply and demand, model will be the fundamental model in which trade-offs and choices will be considered through comparison of costs and benefits of actions.  Production and market structure will be analysed at the firm level.  Macroeconomic issues regarding the interaction of goods and services markets, labour and money at an aggregate level will be modelled.  The role of government policy to address microeconomic market failures and macroeconomic objectives will be examined.","How has the global economy shaped Australia?  How has Australia become so rich?  What are the current economic issues Australia faces? Lectures will look into some of Australia's economic history as well as examining some of the country's current issues such as labour markets and industrial relations, international trade and finance, Australia's political economy, its agriculture, mining and manufacturing sectors. The course will deepen students' understanding of the world around us and its impact on the way we live and work.","The first year Principles of Economics course provided a broad overview of macroeconomics. In this course, the aim is to delve a little deeper into the subject. Macroeconomics is concerned with the behaviour of the economy as a whole. In particular it addresses the big issues which affect us on a day to day basis. As macroeconomists we want to know why some countries grow more quickly than others, why some experience high inflation while others have stable prices and why all countries experience recessions and booms. Furthermore, we want to know if government policy can have an impact on these factors.
The aim of this course is to provide these tools and give a deeper understanding of these issues. It is intended that this course leads on from the first year Principles of Economics course and provides a smooth transition for those intending to pursue macroeconomics in later years.","How has globalization changed Australia and other economies across the globe? Why have flows of goods and services, foreign direct investment and migration increased so tremendously in recent times? And how should we evaluate these phenomena? Who wins and who loses from globalization? What does it imply for workers, consumers, and firms? And how does government policy influence it? The course will expose students both to classical trade theories as well as more recent developments such as the new (new) trade theory. A specific focus will be put on using simple economic models to analyse policy-relevant questions. As this is an introductory undergraduate course in international trade, no previous knowledge of international economics is assumed.","This course is about the design and evaluation of economic and social policies. It provides students with the theoretical tools needed to design such policies and with the empirical tools needed to evaluate them. Students will apply these tools to write policy reports for the policy maker. Case studies and empirical examples will be discussed, and will offer a model for the issues which students are required to research and write about.

It considers both microeconomics - the analysis of choices made by individual decision-making units (households and firms) - and macroeconomics - the analysis of the economy as a whole.  The use of a market, supply and demand, model will be the fundamental model in which trade-offs and choices will be considered through comparison of costs and benefits of actions.  Production and market structure will be analysed at the firm level.  Macroeconomic issues regarding the interaction of goods and services markets, labour and money at an aggregate level will be modelled.  The role of government policy to address microeconomic market failures and macroeconomic objectives will be examined.","How has the global economy shaped Australia?  How has Australia become so rich?  What are the current economic issues Australia faces? Lectures will look into some of Australia's economic history as well as examining some of the country's current issues such as labour markets and industrial relations, international trade and finance, Australia's political economy, its agriculture, mining and manufacturing sectors. The course will deepen students' understanding of the world around us and its impact on the way we live and work.","The first year Principles of Economics course provided a broad overview of macroeconomics. In this course, the aim is to delve a little deeper into the subject. Macroeconomics is concerned with the behaviour of the economy as a whole. In particular it addresses the big issues which affect us on a day to day basis. As macroeconomists we want to know why some countries grow more quickly than others, why some experience high inflation while others have stable prices and why all countries experience recessions and booms. Furthermore, we want to know if government policy can have an impact on these factors.
The aim of this course is to provide these tools and give a deeper understanding of these issues. It is intended that this course leads on from the first year Principles of Economics course and provides a smooth transition for those intending to pursue macroeconomics in later years.","How has globalization changed Australia and other economies across the globe? Why have flows of goods and services, foreign direct investment and migration increased so tremendously in recent times? And how should we evaluate these phenomena? Who wins and who loses from globalization? What does it imply for workers, consumers, and firms? And how does government policy influence it? The course will expose students both to classical trade theories as well as more recent developments such as the new (new) trade theory. A specific focus will be put on using simple economic models to analyse policy-relevant questions. As this is an introductory undergraduate course in international trade, no previous knowledge of international economics is assumed.","The course focuses on the estimation, inference and identification of linear regression models. Particular attention is paid to the econometric theory, to the application of econometrics to real-world problems, and to the interpretation of the estimation results. The first part of the course includes a review on statistics and an introduction to large sample theory. The second part of the course focuses on issues in linear regressions including model misspecification, measurement errors, and endogenous regressors. Topics typically include instrumental variable regressions and panel data. The course will include the use of STATA, a standard software for econometric and statistical analysis.","This course studies the application of economic analysis to the management of the environmental and natural resources. We will consider the role of economic theory in understanding and solving environmental and resource problems and discuss empirical examinations of the theory. Domestic and international policy implications will be addressed. A key assessment component will involve students engaging first-hand in changing behaviour regarding a resource or environmental issue of direct relevance to them. Topics that may be covered include: air and water pollution, sustainability, renewable and non-renewable resource management, and the impact of trade.",,,,,"Deep discipline knowledge  informed and

A general overview of accounting principles relating to the preparation of financial and managerial reports will be presented. The primary focus is to illuminate how accounting information is utilised by a variety of stakeholders in planning, controlling and investing decisions. Topics include: accounting information in its decision making context, record of accounting transactions, understand and analyse financial statements, cost behaviour, determination of product costs, cost-volume-profit analysis, performance management, and budgeting.","This course provides an introduction to the management of financial institutions and intermediaries.  The course focuses on the importance of ensuring good organizational functioning within institutions to manage the varied types of risk that they may be exposed to.  Students are first introduced to the construct of the firm as a legal entity, and how financial institutions have specific requirements that relate to this.  The course then examines the principles of the theory and practice of defining and measuring various types of risk these institutions can be exposed to, and effective policies for successful risk management .  Students are also introduced to international standards of banking practice and how they impact the functioning of the institutions.","This course is an in-depth study of investment portfolios: the theory behind them, construction techniques, asset classes employed and its management. Asset classes examined in the context of portfolio construction will include Equities (both developed and emerging markets), Fixed Income Securities, Commodities, Real Estate, and Alternate Investments. Course participants will revisit and enhance their knowledge of the theoretical foundations of asset pricing, market efficiency and the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Course participants will then develop an Investment Policy Statement (or a Statement of Advice) for an institutional investor, quantitatively forecast characteristics of various asset classes in an economy, and then create an investment portfolio to satisfy the investment requirements. Students will learn various strategies to test the portfolio constructed, issues that impact portfolio performance in achieving investment objectives, and finally evaluate its performance.","This course is about the design and evaluation of economic and social policies. It provides students with the theoretical tools needed to design such policies and with the empirical tools needed to evaluate them. Students will apply these tools to write policy reports for the policy maker. Case studies and empirical examples will be discussed, and will offer a model for the issues which students are required to research and write about. This course is the capstone experience for the B.Ec.",,,,,,,"Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from

It also introduces students to basic legal philosophy, and incorporates a module introducing students to Australian Indigenous legal systems and their interaction with the colonial legal system in Australia.","This course provides students with an introduction to law in its global context in this age of trans-national and inter-jurisdictional practice, with particular focus on public international law and its role in shaping the international legal order. The course commences with an introduction to the development and nature of public international law as well as distinctive elements of international legal reasoning.  It then addresses key features of international law, with topics chosen from: the sources of international law with emphasis on customary international law and the law of treaties; international fact finding; the structure of the international community and participants in the international legal system; the peaceful settlement of international disputes; state responsibility; jurisdiction and immunity; international maritime law and the law of the sea; the use of force; international human rights; the law of armed conflict and International Space Law.","This course introduces students to a variety of subjects relevant to commercial transactions and provides a foundation for subsequent courses addressing related concepts. The course introduces students to commerce in Australia, including the various business structures and regulators, and provides an overview of contract law (a subject covered in more detail in other courses). Other subjects to be covered include sale of goods; commercial leases; insurance law; personal property law and the Personal Property Securities legislation; competition regulation and the Australian Consumer Law; basic concepts of taxation; and international commercial transactions.","The course acquaints students with the common law rules relating to enforceable agreements and puts those rules in their practical perspective. The  course is not directly concerned with the statutory modifications made with respect to specific classes of contract (eg sale of goods), or with the more general controls imposed by the Australian Consumer Law, which are dealt with in other courses, though it will refer to those regimes and explain their relevance. The following topics will be covered: formation; privity of contract; terms and interpretation; performance and termination; vitiating factors; remedies for breach of contract.","The course will begin by considering the historical basis and development of equity. The following areas will then be examined in detail: 1) equitable estoppel; 2) fiduciary obligations; 3) express trusts; (4) resulting and constructive trusts; (5) undue influence and (6) unconscionable conduct or `catching bargains?. Particular attention will be paid to the creation of express trusts, the rights, powers and duties of trustees, and remedies for breaches of trust and fiduciary obligation.","This course examines corporate law in Australia today, including: regulation of companies under Corporations Act; the incorporation process and its consequences; internal regulation and dealing with outsiders; share capital, company membership and disclosure obligations; the duties and liabilities of directors and other officers of a corporation; members' powers and remedies; and the regulation of corporations in financial difficulty including the administration and the winding up processes.","This course will cover procedures applicable to the resolution of civil disputes, including conciliation, mediation, arbitration and judgment, together with the ethical obligations that lawyers bring to these procedures.   Through problem solving and practical role plays students will be critically introduced to the nature of civil process in South Australian and Federal courts and the respective roles and responsibilities of parties (including their legal representatives), mediators, arbitrators and judges in commencing, continuing and conducting these processes.  Particular topics of court adjudication under an adversary system will include: the cost of litigation; initiation and service of process and jurisdiction: joinder of parties and claims; the definition of issues through pleadings and admissions; obtaining evidence through disclosure, inspection and interrogatories and the limits imposed by privileges and immunities; interlocutory injunctions; pre-trial conferences; mediation; judgment without trial including settlement; the nature of judgment; rights of appeal; and the enforcement of judgments.  Duties owed by lawyers to the law, the court, clients, other lawyers and the community will be considered in theory and in practice, both particularly in relation to dispute resolution and more generally, as well as the concept of professional misconduct and wider questions of a lawyer's personal ethics and conflicting duties and values.","Evidence & Advocacy is the study of ""proof""; particularly, what is proof in legal proceedings and how do we prove matters as fact. Through problem solving and practical/interactive role plays, students will critically analyse the laws of evidence applicable to the proof of facts in South Australian and Australian Federal courts. These laws determine the evidence which will be received by courts to establish material facts, the form in which such evidence must be presented and the uses to which such evidence can be put by the court. 
Laws applicable to civil and criminal proceedings are examined with a concentration on the evidential constrictions applicable to criminal proceedings.

The final section of the course will focus on what are some of the present science controversies.","This course focuses on the biology and diversity of multicellular organisms, with evolution as the central theme. It addresses key questions in biology: What are plants and animals? How do they evolve? How do they function? How do they interact with other organisms and the environment? These questions are answered by analysing the scientific evidence that supports current theory","The principal aim of this course is to provide students with the knowledge that will enable them to participate actively in a rational debate about environmental problems. It introduces the 'scientific method' and illustrates its use via laboratory and field practicals that are written up as reports. The lectures cover the significant environmental issues of: resource utilisation and waste, ecosystem services and ecological footprints, global cycles, Australian landscapes and soils, biodiversity, grazing and indigenous knowledge, agricultural problems, invasive species, pests and quarantine, freshwater and marine ecosystems, conservation biology and adaptive management.  There is the opportunity to discuss problems via tutorials.

Lectures and practicals cover plant structure, function, classification, diversity, evolution and responses to environmental stress. Provides a valuable basis for future plant-related courses.","The course will progress students' understanding of the link between the structure and function of organisms using marine invertebrates.  This understanding is made through the use of concepts of phylogeny across the enormous diversity of marine life and progresses to land animals. Major change to marine environments has driven evolution which is demonstrated through adaptations to parasitism, the marine environment and life on land. Using the extraordinary discoveries in the marine realm, cutting edge thinking will be used to explain the emergence of new species and concepts. The biology of the vertebrates will follow groups from fishes to terrestrial vertebrates, including the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The lectures on animal adaptations provide an account of the major evolutionary hurdles in evolution from which all life evolved from the ocean.","This course introduces the core principles of modern ecology, provides basic skills for the conduction of field studies, and fosters the development of the skills needed for the scientific analysis of ecological systems. The topics are integrated into a conceptual framework that allows students to analyse real situations. Topics include the description and study of biological populations and communities, the factors that determine their properties and dynamics, the patterns and consequences of species diversity, and the biotic and abiotic factors that control the dynamics of ecological systems. Across these topics, the impact of human activities on ecosystem processes is discussed. Case studies are used to illustrate the underlying theory, and the application of the ecological theory to the management of natural resources for use and conservation. The course is relevant for students interested in furthering their understanding of ecological principles, in the management of rangelands, wildlife, fisheries, forests, and human made systems, and in the conservation of natural ecosystems.

Lectures outline the fundamental disagreements in approach to science and quantitative sciences and the scientific and societal value of robust experimental methods. Some knowledge of basic statistics is required. Experimental design will be emphasised, and the elements of statistical tests, including linear modelling, will be considered in a variety of biological, planning and legal contexts. Practical work involves use of structured thinking to resolving spatial problems of sampling, computers and software, and will complement methods introduced in lectures.  An understanding of the unique issues of problem solving marine sampling wave exposed and changing ocean environments are developed in a series of workshops.  These workshops provide a sampling and statistical basis for students to consider the fundamental elements of developing their own sampling or experimental projects in an actual or simulated marine environment.  This coverage of fundamental areas of sampling and statistical analysis, known to cause problems for marine biologists in their understanding and implementation of advice from statistician, bridges known gaps between biological training and industry needs.","This course aims to provide an understanding of the patterns of abundance and diversity of marine plants and animals and the processes that structure these patterns.

Successful completion of this course will allow continuation to Level II Geology courses.","Sediments, both ancient and recent, cover much of the earth's surface. Sediments are immensely important economically, as the host of petroleum and mineral deposits, and to the environment, as aquifers, sinks for contaminants, and the home to a large part of the biosphere. The sedimentary record is also the ultimate repository of the annals of Earth's history.  By deciphering the clues held in this record, geologists have reconstructed the history of the earth surface environment, traced the evolution of life, and determined past climate changes.   The sedimentology component of this course will provide a broad background to 1) the description of sedimentary rocks and recognition of sedimentary structures, 2) processes by which sediments are transported, deposited, and converted into rocks, 3) the tectonic setting and features of environments in which sediments accumulate, and  4) use of stratigraphy as a tool in Earth history. The Palaeontology component of this course will be an introduction to the fossil record, with an emphasis on the patterns of evolution during the Phanerozoic and the application of biostratigraphy.","How does the Earth respond to applied force? This course looks at how rocks deform and change shape, and how we can recognise and use structures within rocks to determine ancient magnitudes and orientations of stress fields. Students will be introduced to techniques of recording and analysing structural data and taught how to map rock sequences in the field and interrogate a region to determine how it formed and what has happened to the area since formation.
Details of field trip communicated at start of the course.","This course is designed to give a fundamental background in mineralogy (mineral chemistry, classification and structure) and in the origin, occurrence, identification and classification of igneous and metamorphic rocks. It includes examination of minerals and rocks in hand specimen and thin section.","This course focuses on the chemistry of the natural world and the chemical evolution of the Earth over geological time. We will discuss practical and theoretical geochemistry, with an emphasis on how chemical principles are used to study Earth Sciences. The course is composed of three modules: (a) geochemical fundamentals; (b) natural and anthropogenically perturbed aspects of the Earth's hydrosphere and atmosphere and their interactions with rocks, sediments, soils and the biosphere; and (c) the origin and evolution of Earth (crust-mantle-core) through nuclear and high temperature chemical processes.","The course looks at the minerals industry and the geology and mineralogy of major ore deposits including copper, gold and iron. This information will be integrated with introductory material on the exploration process, mining methods, minerals processing, metals markets and socio-economic factors.","This course will develop knowledge of the Earth as a four-dimensional dynamic system. The megascopic structure of the earth - oceanic and continental crust and lithosphere, and the asthenosphere, will be introduced and compared. The basic dynamic potentials acting on the Earth (heat, gravity) will be examined, and their diverse first order effects explored (isostasy, convection, exhumation, pluming). The concepts of rifting and ocean formation will be examined, as will those of subduction and mantle plumes. Processes of orogenesis will be examined in depth. Recent and Mesozoic evidence (structural, geochemical, geophysical, sedimentological) for the operation of these processes will be examined. We will examine evidence and constraints on interpretation of these processes operating in past geological eras: the Palaeozoic, Proterozoic and Archaean. Emphasis will be placed upon understanding examples from the tectonic evolution of the Australian Plate. 
Details of field trip will be communicated at start of the course.","This course covers the processes that control the formation of ore deposits, energy and geothermal resources. Resource forming processes are examined in the framework of the tectonic, petrogenetic and geochemical evolution of the Earth's crust on local, regional and global geological scales.

Touted as the ?sexiest job of the 21st century? by the Harvard Business Review, and the best current job by Forbes magazine in 2016, students with data science skills are sought after across all industries. 
Data science techniques will enhance your employability regardless of the degree you are studying. Why? Because ?big data? and advanced problem solving skills inform decision making and innovation for all organisations. Scientists are transforming the research frontier by using machine learning techniques to find Higgs bosons, classify galaxies or unravel genetic codes. Businesses are using the same techniques to identify credit card fraud, perform social network analysis and to develop automatic approaches to targeted marketing. 
In this course, you will become familiar with all major modern approaches to data science, including machine learning techniques and big data analysis strategies. Critically, students in this course will learn via an innovative and multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving. After a basic introduction to the different types of data analysis problem, students will be introduced to a variety of algorithms from the research frontier. To keep the course accessible to a broad audience, no mathematical knowledge will be assumed, and students will instead gain a hands-on, intuitive knowledge of how the algorithms work by using simple spreadsheet examples. A wide variety of problems from physics, chemistry, biology, health sciences and business will be used to encourage students to view problems through the lens of a different discipline; this will enhance your ability to spot innovative solutions to research problems in your own field. For business students, it will give you an ability to determine what your company or employer needs to remain competitive.
Through this topic, you will develop transferable skills that will allow you to connect science to everyday issues, and you will also learn how to use real-world problems to solve new problems in science.","The course develops a framework to understand the ethical issues of collecting and managing data sets.  We examine how data are ethically used in society, and the impact of unethical practice.  The course covers aspects of data ownership, privacy, anonymity, validity and fairness.

These questions are answered by analysing the scientific evidence that supports current theory","The principal aim of this course is to provide students with the knowledge that will enable them to participate actively in a rational debate about environmental problems. It introduces the 'scientific method' and illustrates its use via laboratory and field practicals that are written up as reports. The lectures cover the significant environmental issues of: resource utilisation and waste, ecosystem services and ecological footprints, global cycles, Australian landscapes and soils, biodiversity, grazing and indigenous knowledge, agricultural problems, invasive species, pests and quarantine, freshwater and marine ecosystems, conservation biology and adaptive management.  There is the opportunity to discuss problems via tutorials.

Lectures and practicals cover plant structure, function, classification, diversity, evolution and responses to environmental stress. Provides a valuable basis for future plant-related courses.","The course will progress students' understanding of the link between the structure and function of organisms using marine invertebrates.  This understanding is made through the use of concepts of phylogeny across the enormous diversity of marine life and progresses to land animals. Major change to marine environments has driven evolution which is demonstrated through adaptations to parasitism, the marine environment and life on land. Using the extraordinary discoveries in the marine realm, cutting edge thinking will be used to explain the emergence of new species and concepts. The biology of the vertebrates will follow groups from fishes to terrestrial vertebrates, including the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The lectures on animal adaptations provide an account of the major evolutionary hurdles in evolution from which all life evolved from the ocean.","This course introduces the core principles of modern ecology, provides basic skills for the conduction of field studies, and fosters the development of the skills needed for the scientific analysis of ecological systems. The topics are integrated into a conceptual framework that allows students to analyse real situations. Topics include the description and study of biological populations and communities, the factors that determine their properties and dynamics, the patterns and consequences of species diversity, and the biotic and abiotic factors that control the dynamics of ecological systems. Across these topics, the impact of human activities on ecosystem processes is discussed. Case studies are used to illustrate the underlying theory, and the application of the ecological theory to the management of natural resources for use and conservation. The course is relevant for students interested in furthering their understanding of ecological principles, in the management of rangelands, wildlife, fisheries, forests, and human made systems, and in the conservation of natural ecosystems.
Details of field trip communicated at start of the course.","Using industry standards in the practice of marine biology this course provides education in the methods of collection, analysis and reporting of coastal, aquarium and institutional laboratory data, and their experimental design. Lectures outline the fundamental disagreements in approach to science and quantitative sciences and the scientific and societal value of robust experimental methods. Some knowledge of basic statistics is required. Experimental design will be emphasised, and the elements of statistical tests, including linear modelling, will be considered in a variety of biological, planning and legal contexts. Practical work involves use of structured thinking to resolving spatial problems of sampling, computers and software, and will complement methods introduced in lectures.  An understanding of the unique issues of problem solving marine sampling wave exposed and changing ocean environments are developed in a series of workshops.  These workshops provide a sampling and statistical basis for students to consider the fundamental elements of developing their own sampling or experimental projects in an actual or simulated marine environment.  This coverage of fundamental areas of sampling and statistical analysis, known to cause problems for marine biologists in their understanding and implementation of advice from statistician, bridges known gaps between biological training and industry needs.","This course aims to provide an understanding of the patterns of abundance and diversity of marine plants and animals and the processes that structure these patterns. The course focuses on the practical measurement and interpretation used to assess variation in ecological pattern and process, with some emphasis on human driven impacts. Particular emphasis is placed on temperate coasts for which the Australian population is largest and most dense, and its coastal-ocean problems are most expensive and intense.

It starts with the construction of the planet in the solar nebula, to Earth's transformation to a warm wet greenhouse planet, through the evolution and extinction events that shaped and still shape life on the planet. We look at the water world that is our earth; the hydrosphere, atmosphere and the oceans. We finish with a look at our human effects on the earth system, and take a look at our extraordinary Australian environment. We undertake a day long field excursion to see some of this environment first-hand.","In this course students will question and then explore the accuracy and potential validity of the Science found in movies, television, across a wide range of media formats and more broadly on the internet.  Students will develop the skills required for future courses and careers with a focus on; communication to a non-specialist audience using a variety of formats, digital literacy, data interpretation, interdisciplinary collaboration and group investigations.  The final section of the course will focus on what are some of the present science controversies.","Volcanoes; the only earth process not trying to kill Australians. Why is it that we have no active volcanoes? Will that always be the case? Why does Australia have earthquakes? Could we have a 10.0 magnitude quake? As Will Durant said ""Civilisation exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice"". Enrol in Planet Earth to find answers to these questions.
We'll play games of stones, where you'll learn to classify every mineral and rock you're bound to see in your life. Field trips will take us to the coast to see rocks in their natural habitat, you'll learn how to read history from the Earth, and enjoy the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to the real world. 
Successful completion of this course will allow continuation to Level II Geology courses.","Sediments, both ancient and recent, cover much of the earth's surface. Sediments are immensely important economically, as the host of petroleum and mineral deposits, and to the environment, as aquifers, sinks for contaminants, and the home to a large part of the biosphere. The sedimentary record is also the ultimate repository of the annals of Earth's history.  By deciphering the clues held in this record, geologists have reconstructed the history of the earth surface environment, traced the evolution of life, and determined past climate changes.   The sedimentology component of this course will provide a broad background to 1) the description of sedimentary rocks and recognition of sedimentary structures, 2) processes by which sediments are transported, deposited, and converted into rocks, 3) the tectonic setting and features of environments in which sediments accumulate, and  4) use of stratigraphy as a tool in Earth history. The Palaeontology component of this course will be an introduction to the fossil record, with an emphasis on the patterns of evolution during the Phanerozoic and the application of biostratigraphy.","How does the Earth respond to applied force? This course looks at how rocks deform and change shape, and how we can recognise and use structures within rocks to determine ancient magnitudes and orientations of stress fields. Students will be introduced to techniques of recording and analysing structural data and taught how to map rock sequences in the field and interrogate a region to determine how it formed and what has happened to the area since formation.
Details of field trip communicated at start of the course.","This course is designed to give a fundamental background in mineralogy (mineral chemistry, classification and structure) and in the origin, occurrence, identification and classification of igneous and metamorphic rocks. It includes examination of minerals and rocks in hand specimen and thin section.","This course focuses on the chemistry of the natural world and the chemical evolution of the Earth over geological time. We will discuss practical and theoretical geochemistry, with an emphasis on how chemical principles are used to study Earth Sciences. The course is composed of three modules: (a) geochemical fundamentals; (b) natural and anthropogenically perturbed aspects of the Earth's hydrosphere and atmosphere and their interactions with rocks, sediments, soils and the biosphere; and (c) the origin and evolution of Earth (crust-mantle-core) through nuclear and high temperature chemical processes.","The course looks at the minerals industry and the geology and mineralogy of major ore deposits including copper, gold and iron. This information will be integrated with introductory material on the exploration process, mining methods, minerals processing, metals markets and socio-economic factors.","This course will develop knowledge of the Earth as a four-dimensional dynamic system. The megascopic structure of the earth - oceanic and continental crust and lithosphere, and the asthenosphere, will be introduced and compared. The basic dynamic potentials acting on the Earth (heat, gravity) will be examined, and their diverse first order effects explored (isostasy, convection, exhumation, pluming). The concepts of rifting and ocean formation will be examined, as will those of subduction and mantle plumes. Processes of orogenesis will be examined in depth. Recent and Mesozoic evidence (structural, geochemical, geophysical, sedimentological) for the operation of these processes will be examined. We will examine evidence and constraints on interpretation of these processes operating in past geological eras: the Palaeozoic, Proterozoic and Archaean. Emphasis will be placed upon understanding examples from the tectonic evolution of the Australian Plate. 
Details of field trip will be communicated at start of the course.","This course covers the processes that control the formation of ore deposits, energy and geothermal resources. Resource forming processes are examined in the framework of the tectonic, petrogenetic and geochemical evolution of the Earth's crust on local, regional and global geological scales. Thus, the course draws upon igneous and metamorphic processes, geochemistry and structural geology.  
The course also introduces geochemical techniques that can be applied to the detection and mapping of mineral resources. Practical work emphasises the mesoscopic recognition of ore minerals and textures in both hand sample and drill core, and the methods of data collection presentation and analysis of geochemical data in mapping ore deposits.","Deep discipline knowledge  informed and infused by cutting edge research, scaffolded throughout their program of studies acquired from personal interaction with research active educators, from year 1 accredited or validated against national or international standards (for relevant programs) , 1-4, Critical thinking and problem solving  steeped in research methods and rigor based on empirical evidence and the scientific approach to knowledge development demonstrated through appropriate and relevant assessment , 2-4, Teamwork and communication skills  developed from, with, and via the SGDE honed through assessment and practice throughout the program of studies encouraged and valued in all aspects of learning , 1, Career and leadership readiness  technology savvy professional and, where relevant, fully accredited forward thinking and well informed tested and validated by work based experiences , na, Intercultural and ethical competency  adept at operating in other cultures comfortable with different nationalities and social contexts able to determine and contribute to desirable social outcomes demonstrated by study abroad or with an understanding of indigenous knowledges , 4, Self-awareness and emotional intelligence  a capacity for self-reflection and a willingness to engage in self-appraisal open to objective and constructive feedback from supervisors and peers able to negotiate difficult social situations, defuse conflict and engage positively in purposeful debate , 4","1, Locate, access and evaluate scientific concepts, 2, Understanding of the process of science and how it is undertaken, 3, Research skills (including acquisition and analysis of data and its interpretation), 4, Develop scholarly arguements using scientific evidence, 5, Communication skills to scientific and non-scientific audiences, 6, Collaborate in small groups to discover knowledge",", A successful student should be able to:, 1, demonstrate proficiency in practical skills relevant to an introductory geology course, 2, describe the earth's interior, including the structure, composition, and magnetic field;, 3, explain the internal processes acting on the Earth;, 4, describe the theory of plate tectonics and relate this theory to geologic processes and structures such as volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain chains, continents and ocean floors;, 5, understand and describe the formation and physical properties of minerals and rocks and use that knowledge to identify them;, 6, describe rock processes in terms of plate tectonics;, 7, explain earth structures and be able to distinguish three-dimensional rock structures and faults from geologic maps;, 8, use information learned in class and develop observation skills to be able to recognize the various geological features and materials the earth is constructed from in the field.","A successful student in this course should be able to:, 1, Demonstrate proficiency in common practical skills in Sedimentary Geology, 2, Interpret the processes responsible for the deposition of the sediment from the nature of the sediment and sedimentary structures present within the sedimentary rock;, 3, Understand the depositional environment of a sedimentary rock package based on recognition of facies associations;

In this course, the key results of one-variable calculus are extended to higher dimensions: differentiation, integration, and the link between them provided by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are all generalised.  The machinery developed can be applied to another generalisation of one-variable Calculus, namely to complex calculus, and the course also provides an introduction to this subject. The material covered in this course forms the basis for mathematical analysis and application across an extremely broad range of areas, essential for anyone studying the hard sciences, engineering, or mathematical economics/finance.

Topics covered are: introduction to multivariable calculus; differentiation of scalar- and vector-valued functions; higher-order derivatives, extrema, Lagrange multipliers and the implicit function theorem; integration over regions, volumes, paths and surfaces; Green's, Stokes' and Gauss's theorems; differential forms; curvilinear coordinates; an introduction to complex numbers and functions; complex differentiation; complex integration and Cauchy's theorems; and conformal mappings.","Most ""real life"" systems that are described mathematically, be they physical, biological, financial or economic, are described by means of differential equations. Our ability to predict the way in which these systems evolve or behave is determined by our ability to model these systems and find solutions of the equations explicitly or approximately. Every application and differential equation presents its own challenges, but there are various classes of differential equations, and for some of these there are established approaches and methods for solving them. 
 
Topics covered are: first order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), higher order ODEs, systems of ODEs, series solutions of ODEs, interpretation of solutions, Fourier analysis and solution of linear partial differential equations using the method of separation of variables.","This course provides an introduction to quantum mechanics and continues the development of practical problem solving using laboratory experiments.
