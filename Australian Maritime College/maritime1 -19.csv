As a result, computational and data analysis skills are highly desirable and useful across the many sub-disciplines of the environmental and marine sciences. This unit provides and introduction to processing, visualizing, and interpreting quantitative, spatial marine and environmental science data using scientific computing techniques. Computation methods and visualizations will be performed using a variety of software and computing languages including MATLAB, ArcGIS and Python.","The emphasis in this unit is on training scientists to be literate in statistical issues so that both ""consumers"" and ""producers"" of data analysis will be able to effectively communicate. Students will be able to critically assess, understand, and use information (qualitative and quantitative) that has been collected, analysed and presented by scientists from a range of disciplines. This will be achieved by providing a conceptual understanding of the methods of data analyses commonly used by scientists. Given the type of question asked and the data collected, students will be able to present and communicate data/information using statistics as a tool.","This unit provides students with the skills required to ensure that their engineering projects are thoroughly planned, well managed and successful. It focuses on project management methods, skills and strategies. Participants develop their knowledge through the application of these new skills to maritime engineering projects.","The purpose of this unit is to provide students with an understanding of modelling and simulation techniques and their application to the analysis of marine engineering systems. Students are introduced to numerical methods, control systems, first and second order systems, and the associated modelling strategies. This unit is structured around the application software MATLAB/Simulink which students will use to create programs that simulate marine systems such as pump-pipe networks, heating ventilating and air conditioning, and propulsion systems.","This unit aims to provide a thorough understanding and appreciation of the nature and processes of research.

Students will gain an understanding of issues which underlie the practice of research by studying conceptual frameworks of different researchers, by analysis of completed research studies, and by application of what they learn through their own research study.","In this unit, students develop the techniques required for the design of surface vessels. They develop the conceptual and analytical skills necessary at a detailed level of ship design with a particular emphasis on design driver identification and initial parameter estimates and the effects of regulatory, practical and economic constraints on design. Students are also introduced to the concepts of ship behaviour in waves and the process of evaluating the seakeeping and maneuvering characteristics of a vessel. Students will develop a concept design based on an appraisal of operational requirements via a clearly structured and rational process with a shortlist of fundamental integral systems for a concept design.","In this unit, students learn how to determine hydrostatic data for any hull form, and predict the influence of hull form on vessel stability characteristics. Students are also introduced to means of determining a vessel's global longitudinal strength and methods of analysing local structure. Additionally students are introduced to an overview of the naval architectural design process and the more prominent regulatory constraints.","This unit gives students an understanding of the functional purpose of the machinery systems used on board a variety of ships.
