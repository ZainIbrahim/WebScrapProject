Although international business has many similarities with domestic business, there are important differences. At the international level, the globalisation of the world economy and differences between countries present both opportunities and challenges to international business. Managers of international businesses need to take into account the globalised business environment and its broad implications when making strategic decisions and managing ongoing operations.","To be successful, a company must develop competitive marketing strategies that effectively position its products against competitors and give it the strongest possible competitive advantage. The task of marketing management is to develop, maintain and/or defend an organisation's competitive position based on strategic planning that aligns with its objectives, skills, and resources and changing market opportunities.","Firms are paying more attention to the development of new products and services to enhance their market position. Commercialising innovative products and services on a timely basis is a key to not only profit but in some industries, survival. However, despite the significant investment in screening and developing new products and services, statistics reflect continuing high failure rates. This underscores the need for better management of new product and service commercialisation.","As global business continues to grow, understanding marketing in all cultures is essential. Understanding diversity is critical due to cultural, economic, technological, political and legal differences, which affect consumer choices and consequently the marketing process. International marketing recognises that consumers across the globe have diverse needs, preferences, and expectations. International marketing considers the opportunities to market new and existing products and services that meet consumer preferences and expectations at a global level. The focus of this unit is on developing your knowledge of factors that affect consumer decision-making at a global level.","The professional service sector is growing rapidly and professional service firms (PSFs) contribute significantly to economic growth in most economies. PSFs work in a very competitive and dynamic environment and face both increasing opportunities and challenges. PSFs have unique characteristics that set them apart from other service firms. PSFs are knowledge intensive service firms who deliver highly customised services across a range of sectors such as consultancy, health, engineering, and IT services. These characteristics justify consideration of whether conventional marketing management concepts and models need to be adapted to better account for service-dominant economies and for the successful marketing of business relationships in PSFs.",This unit is divided into two components.Â Â The first component deals with finance â the sourcing and management of funds as well as the valuation of your venture. The second component deals with risk â the understanding of what risk is and how to manage it in a business venture.,"The increasing use of the Internet and other digital media by both business and consumers is having a significant effect on business globally. For consumers, information and communication technologies (ICT) provide more information, convenience, and a wider range of, and access to, product choices. For businesses, ICT provides new channels to market their products, new ways to build and establish value-creating relationships with their customers, as well as opportunities to expand into new markets. However, reaching, acquiring and establishing long-term relationships with customers require different approaches in a business to business (B2B) than a business to consumers (B2C) space. It is the case for digital and direct marketing as well; while the tools are the same, how B2B marketers apply the tools is different.","Brands and brand management have spread far beyond the traditional view of consumer-goods marketers. Brands are increasingly important for companies in almost every industry; industrial and Business to Business (B2B) organisations in particular need to use branding in a strategic way.Â Â In many industries, as products become increasingly similar, organisations are turning to branding as a way to differentiate their offerings and create customer preferences for them. In contemporary markets where competition is multifaceted, brands are valuable assets in developing effective marketing strategies and competitive advantage. Brands and brand equity need to be recognized as strategic assets and the basis of competitive advantage and long-term profitability.","Sales management and personal selling are critical to organisational success, especially in highly competitive markets. Good personal selling skills guide sales professionals toward alignment with buyers, by helping them overcome their problems and challenges, and creating value for both the customer and seller. Sales management skills are critical in developing compensation packages, and in training and motivation programs to make the organisation's selling efforts more efficient and effective.","Businesses are changing constantly, and markets are moving at a rapid pace. This means that market research is critical for keeping abreast of such changes. Market research comprises a critical facet of marketing practice; playing a central role in supporting marketing management, business decision-making and helping to solve business problems. Market research is the key to identifying market opportunities and underpins the ability of a firm to make sound decisions.",,"Explain theories and concepts related to marketing management., Apply specific marketing management theories and concepts., Develop, implement and evaluate marketing management strategies., Communicate orally and in written contexts.","Discuss the theories and concepts of new product and service development and apply them to practice., Analyse factors that impact new product and service development decisions., Plan commercialisation strategies and develop implementation plans for new product and service development.","Discuss and analyse international marketing theories and concepts., Apply knowledge of international marketing theories and concepts to identify and assess international marketing opportunities., Critically evaluate international marketing actions and strategies to gain competitive advantage",,,,,"Explain and apply theories and concepts underpinning sales management and personal selling., Develop a sales management plan., Identify and analyse the ethical and social issues associated with sales management and personal selling., Develop implementation plans and assess sales strategy decisions for sales management and personal selling.","Explain the theories and principles of market research and compare different approaches, Develop and implement a market research plan to solve marketing problem, Apply and appraise the ethical issues associated with the market research process"

The primary purpose of managerial and cost accounting is to provide relevant information to managers within an organisation. Managerial accounting can be thought of as the informal language used within the organisation to facilitate planning, control, coordination and performance assessment. Decision contexts can vary from the broad strategic planning and resource allocation decisions made at corporate or divisional level, to the more specific cost and performance information necessary to monitor individual products, customers or segments. The ultimate measure of success is whether or not internal decision making has been improved as a result of the relevance, quality and timeliness of information provided by the management accounting function.","This unit provides managers with an introduction to a comprehensive range of key data analysis, statistics, microeconomic and macroeconomic topics.

CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and wellbeing. Consequently, boundaries between the CAM domain and that of the dominant healthcare system are not always sharp or fixed, which creates uncertainty among consumers and health professionals regarding the use of CAMs. Complementary medicine is an increasing feature of healthcare practice, with recent surveys finding that approximately two-thirds of Australians regularly use a CAM product (typically vitamin and/or herbal preparations).In this unit, you will be given an overview of CAM as practiced in Australia and around the world. This will include looking at who uses CAM, their motivations for using CAM, and the ethical and professional issues that CAMs raise in health professionals. This unit will also focus on the use of CAMs in alignment with quality use of medicines principles. The focus will be on the safety of CAMs (adverse events, drug interactions) and use in special patient groups (pregnancy, older people, and children). This will enable you to make better decisions regarding the need to use CAMs, the appropriateness of CAM for your patients in light of other available treatment options, and how to educate patients regarding their use and monitor the outcomes.","Until recently, the phrases 'evidence-based medicine' and 'complementary and alternative medicine' were considered to be contradictory. However, perceptions of the role of evidence-based medicine in complementary and alternative medicine have shifted as the use of complementary medicines has continued to increase and become more closely integrated with 'mainstream' healthcare - in part due to the significant expansion in CAM's research base that has occurred over that past decade. Evidence-based complementary medicine will explore the principles of evidence-based medicine, and how these principles can be applied to evaluate the range of complementary and alternative medicines and therapies that are commonly utilised in Western nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, perceptions of the role of evidence-based medicine in complementary and alternative medicine have shifted as the use of complementary medicines has continued to increase and become more closely integrated with 'mainstream' healthcare - in part due to the significant expansion in CAM's research base that has occurred over that past decade. Evidence-based complementary medicine will explore the principles of evidence-based medicine, and how these principles can be applied to evaluate the range of complementary and alternative medicines and therapies that are commonly utilised in Western nations.","Complementary andÂ Â alternativeÂ Â medicine (CAM)Â Â isÂ Â a broadÂ Â domainÂ Â of healingÂ Â resourcesÂ Â that encompassesÂ Â all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and wellbeing. Consequently, boundaries between the CAM domain and that of the dominant healthcare system are not always sharp or fixed, which creates uncertainty among consumers and health professionals regarding the use of CAMs. Complementary medicine is an increasing feature of healthcare practice, with recent surveys finding that approximately two-thirds of Australians regularly use a CAM product (typically vitamin and/or herbal preparations).In this unit, you will be given an overview of CAM as practiced in Australia and around the world. This will include looking at who uses CAM, their motivations for using CAM, and the ethical and professional issues that CAMs raise in health professionals. This unit will also focus on the use of CAMs in alignment with quality use of medicines principles. The focus will be on the safety of CAMs (adverse events, drug interactions) and use in special patient groups (pregnancy, older people, and children).
