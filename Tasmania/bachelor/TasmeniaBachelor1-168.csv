Influenced by 18th and 19th century humanistic thought of liberalism (Adam Smith) , economic nationalism (Friedrich List) and socialism (Karl Marx) among many others, the discipline has focused on understanding the role of states, firms and workers in the international extraction, production, transportation, consumption and disposal of goods and services (the extraction -disposal chain) . The assumption has been that there are no important impacts on the natural world . From a post -humanistic perspective , however, and in the era of the Anthropocene , analysts must now also address the reciprocal impact of humans on nature and nature on humans .","Psychology, the study of human behaviour, is wondrous in its complexity. Individual behaviour is affected and influenced by many factors, including biological, neurological, psychological and cultural. Psychologists can and do measure all of these factors and understand that the relationships and effects among them are many and varied. Some factors influence behaviour directly and others indirectly; some effects and influences are large, while others are small; and the mix among these is often variable, sensitive to situational and behavioural contexts, age, motivations and gender. As knowledge and technology continue to advance, psychology researchers are asking increasingly complex and nuanced questions about human behaviour. To successfully integrate and interpret data from these studies requires knowledge of advanced research methods and advanced statistical tools. In this unit you will extend your knowledge and skills to help you to make principled choices among a variety of advanced statistical tools, choices that are often not clear cut for complex questions.

We examine the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, Huns, Vandals, Goths, Vikings, and other medieval peoples. Barbarians moved from being Roman outsiders to establishing their own kingdoms, pagans were converted to Christianity, Latin learning found a new home after the decline of the western Roman Empire, Islam had its origins, and new trade routes brought increased wealth as well as conflict between Vikings and other Europeans. At the same time, some fundamental aspects of everyday society remained constant for centuries. This unit uses written and archaeological evidence to examine this fascinating coexistence of change and ongoing continuities.

Influenced by 18th and 19th century humanistic thought of liberalism (Adam Smith) , economic nationalism (Friedrich List) and socialism (Karl Marx) among many others, the discipline has focused on understanding the role of states, firms and workers in the international extraction, production, transportation, consumption and disposal of goods and services (the extraction -disposal chain) . The assumption has been that there are no important impacts on the natural world . From a post -humanistic perspective , however, and in the era of the Anthropocene , analysts must now also address the reciprocal impact of humans on nature and nature on humans .","Psychology, the study of human behaviour, is wondrous in its complexity. Individual behaviour is affected and influenced by many factors, including biological, neurological, psychological and cultural. Psychologists can and do measure all of these factors and understand that the relationships and effects among them are many and varied. Some factors influence behaviour directly and others indirectly; some effects and influences are large, while others are small; and the mix among these is often variable, sensitive to situational and behavioural contexts, age, motivations and gender. As knowledge and technology continue to advance, psychology researchers are asking increasingly complex and nuanced questions about human behaviour. To successfully integrate and interpret data from these studies requires knowledge of advanced research methods and advanced statistical tools. In this unit you will extend your knowledge and skills to help you to make principled choices among a variety of advanced statistical tools, choices that are often not clear cut for complex questions. You will learn and apply principles to assist with consolidating and interpreting complex data.

We examine the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, Huns, Vandals, Goths, Vikings, and other medieval peoples. Barbarians moved from being Roman outsiders to establishing their own kingdoms, pagans were converted to Christianity, Latin learning found a new home after the decline of the western Roman Empire, Islam had its origins, and new trade routes brought increased wealth as well as conflict between Vikings and other Europeans. At the same time, some fundamental aspects of everyday society remained constant for centuries. This unit uses written and archaeological evidence to examine this fascinating coexistence of change and ongoing continuities.

These options include instruments such as legislation and market-based approaches; and methods such as community engagement and outreach. We also critically examine the effectiveness of such measures, and consider how we might achieve better management outcomes. These topics are exemplified through case studies in land use planning, food systems, waste management, coastal management, wetlands and biodiversity conservation.","This foundation unit in Geography and Environmental Studies develops your knowledge of the ways in which people turn space into place, how patterns of landforms, soils, plants and animals form on the surface of the earth, and how cultures, societies and economies manage, and are affected by, ecosystem processes.

Individual behaviour is affected and influenced by many factors, including biological, neurological, psychological and cultural. Psychologists can and do measure all of these factors and understand that the relationships and effects among them are many and varied. Some factors influence behaviour directly and others indirectly; some effects and influences are large, while others are small; and the mix among these is often variable, sensitive to situational and behavioural contexts, age, motivations and gender. As knowledge and technology continue to advance, psychology researchers are asking increasingly complex and nuanced questions about human behaviour. To successfully integrate and interpret data from these studies requires knowledge of advanced research methods and advanced statistical tools. In this unit you will extend your knowledge and skills to help you to make principled choices among a variety of advanced statistical tools, choices that are often not clear cut for complex questions. You will learn and apply principles to assist with consolidating and interpreting complex data.

Detection and attribution of human induced climate change requires an understanding of the mechanisms of natural climate variability as well as trends in climate. Earth's climate is a coupled system between atmosphere, ocean, land surface, biota, snow and ice. Gaining an understanding of how our climate system works is an important first step to more confidently diagnosing and predicting the effects and impacts of human induced climate change. In this unit we will learn how Earth's climate works. We will begin to understand mechanisms underpinning important known natural climate variations such as El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Antarctic Oscillation. To achieve these ends, we examine global observations (in situ and by satellite) and learn about global climate models; consider detection and attribution techniques to discern human induced climate change above natural variability; and examine recent statements by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on human induced climate change.",,"Conservation of geological features and landscapes is a global priority.

The 'island-continent' of Australia comprises over 12,000 islands, islets and rocky outcrops, while the island-State of Tasmania is an archipelago of 334 islands. Islands have distinct geographies and their peoples have varied cultural identities. These particular landforms, and the seascapes that surround them, seem especially hard-wired into Western conceptions of self, place, and planet. Islands are also at the frontline of major environmental and social changes. In this unit, we study a range of issues that affect island places and people—among those issues are climate change, heritage management, tourism, economic development, environmental challenges, and governance. These issues are central to professional careers in fields such as regional development, local government, natural resource management and environmental planning and conservation. A major research project enables you to focus on an area of study about island geographies that interests you and that project may vary according to hemisphere, ocean, island group, jurisdiction, or challenges faced. A three-day field trip enables you to take insights from the cases studied in the class and see whether, how, and to what extent they are present on Bruny Island. The trip also provides crucial training in field techniques in human geography; and is informed by different kinds of field work and analysis including participant observation, qualitative interviewing, visual and textual analysis.

Forty years of uneven globalisation has been accompanied by the rise of corporations, regional and international institutions, and international nongovernmental agencies. As important influencers of decision-making, these agencies have both undermined and transformed the nation state's position as the key actor in world affairs. Despite national, regional and global intergovernmental and multistakeholder governance efforts, the world remains beset with problems. These range from transnational terrorism, pandemic disease, human rights atrocities, war, weapons of mass destruction and global injustices from deep gender inequality to the dramatic, new and daunting sustainability challenges including of climate change that existing institutions seem ill-equipped to resolve. How should these challenges be met? Can states acting alone solve these old and new global problems as the new populist nationalism appears to believe? Or should regional and international institutions and new multistakeholder governance organisations play a larger role? How should we address other important issues such as the world's economic division into the rich, developed 'North' and the poor, developing 'South'?","This is the core intermediate unit for any students enrolled in the Bachelor of Justice Studies.

The unit introduces students to the theory of social justice, develops an understanding of the framework of international law instruments and explores the role of human right advocacy (evidence gathering, report writing) with a primarily focus on efforts to protect against global threats to human and environmental health. The reality is that justice professionals are frequently faced with complex challenges that are international in scope involving human rights abuses, transnational crime, violent conflict and acts of terror. Consequently, they will need to understand their role in the documenting and reporting of these violations of the rule of law.

Second, to investigate the nature of regulatory mechanisms and the social control of environmental crime, by considering issues surrounding law enforcement practices, compliance mechanisms, prosecution, and crime prevention as these pertain to the environment. Third, to investigate the nature of the relationship between changes to specific environments and the criminalisation process, with particular reference to the causes and contexts of environmental crime, the social processes that underpin environmental victimisation and how the law is mobilised in relation to conflicts over environmental issues.","In this unit students will investigate different approaches to justice. The unit introduces students to theorists such (Plato, Socrates, Kant, Hobbes Locke, and Rawls) Through a justice discourse students will consider the nature and characteristics of justice. Students will also study the quality of substantive social justice through the lens of, power, race, class, gender.

Who is equal?), and provides a framework for thinking about contemporary political and ethical issues, such as how we should respond to climate change. This unit provides an introduction to the world's oldest academic discipline and will help students to develop the rigorous thinking that is the hallmark of philosophy-a skill that is transferable to almost any walk of life. This unit complements HPH102 Philosophy 2: Mind and Metaphysics, but can be taken independently of that unit.","This unit uses the theoretical concept of ‘Lifeworlds’ (lived social, cultural, political and economic realities) to frame an exploration of the Lifeworlds of palawa People in lutruwita/Tasmania, inclusive a small comparative component relating to Noongar and Navajo Peoples. The Lifeworld approach recognises our lived realm as shaped by understandings that are held in common.","The course of climate change can be altered, and science tells us the next decade will be crucial. Averting a climate catastrophe depends on rapid action to reduce greenhouse gases, as well as widespread adaptation to minimise the impact of the changes already being felt. This unit considers why we have not acted quickly as a society so far and what some of our options are going forward. We will explore policy responses and practical solutions that may help us reduce the most damaging changes to Earth’s climate and associated impacts on human and natural systems. Building on the knowledge of climate science gained in Introduction to the Science of Climate Change, the unit explores pathways to reduce the most extreme effects of climate change, including international agreements on reduction of greenhouse gases and other mitigation measures such as carbon sequestration and drawdown and alternative energy sources. The unit additionally examines social movement demands and communication of climate change. In this unit you will also look at climate change through the lens of ethics, justice and injustice, and investigate how indigenous knowledges can instruct us in our responses to climate change. You will think about climate change and system change and ask whether current economic systems based on growth are compatible with averting catastrophic climate change.","HGA138: Society Culture and Health explores the ways in which social and cultural factors and power relations shape the distribution of health and illness and experiences of health and illness in contemporary Australia. The unit will help you to develop critical thinking skills and provide an understanding of the role of social and cultural factors in health and illness related issues such as health inequality, wellness, alternative medicine, chronic illness and cosmetic surgery.","Gender & World explores the shape(s) and impact(s) of gendered assumptions on human interactions in diverse areas of the world and in different historical periods. This unit focuses on how people have acted and do act on the basis of their gendered assumptions, and examines worldly practices which are based on gendered foundations. Gender and sexual difference are examined in their roles as world-organising principles (that is, as abstract categories) and elements (that is, as material realities). This unit also provides students with a global perspective on Gender Studies.","Sociology is essential for understanding the turbulence, change, diversity and mobility of the modern world. Sociology offers a precise way to understand, track and assess how ever-changing aspirations, technologies and economies impact on our social relations and cultures.

Forty years of uneven globalisation has been accompanied by the rise of corporations, regional and international institutions, and international nongovernmental agencies. As important influencers of decision-making, these agencies have both undermined and transformed the nation state's position as the key actor in world affairs. Despite national, regional and global intergovernmental and multistakeholder governance efforts, the world remains beset with problems. These range from transnational terrorism, pandemic disease, human rights atrocities, war, weapons of mass destruction and global injustices from deep gender inequality to the dramatic, new and daunting sustainability challenges including of climate change that existing institutions seem ill-equipped to resolve. How should these challenges be met? Can states acting alone solve these old and new global problems as the new populist nationalism appears to believe? Or should regional and international institutions and new multistakeholder governance organisations play a larger role? How should we address other important issues such as the world's economic division into the rich, developed 'North' and the poor, developing 'South'?","This unit explores broad ranging and contemporary aspects of Australian politics and policy, including democratic principles and Australian institutions, values and Australian culture, the Australian electoral system and campaigns, forms of political representation and the role of lobby groups, the workings of the Australian state, its courts, levels of government, and policy making forums. Students  will be exposed to and have the opportunity to research contemporary political and public policy controversies across a broad range of issues including democracy in principle and practice, the 'left, centre and right' in Australian politics, contested national identity, and the role of parties, public participation, the Prime Minister, ministerial staff, the separation of powers and federalism.","This unit applies a sociological lens to the terrain of racial, religious and ethnic relations in Australia. It introduces theories of race, ethnicity, indigeneity and whiteness and applies these to historical and contemporary race and religious relations and the empirical research on Australian Indigenous, settler, migrant and refugee peoples. Specifically, the unit examines the history of Australia's relationship as a settler society with its Indigenous peoples, with a particular emphasis on citizenship rights and realities. The unit also critically examines the Australian post-war immigration programme, and the experiences of different migrant, religous and refugee groups in overcoming discrimination and adapting to Australian society. It addresses the processes of ethnic and religious identity construction, cultural diversity, multiculturalism and transnational communities in the context of globalisation. These are central social issues for Australians in their everyday lives and in political and social policy.","This unit will enable students to understand how tourism and cultural industries have dramatically changed our lives. Cultural industries have grown significantly, with examples such as museums, regional festivals and wilderness adventures. At the same time there is an increasing capacity for travel and an increasing need to replace income earned from traditional industries with those from tourism. Different societies are now not only in greater contact with each other but also relating to each other in new ways, as well as benefitting from the growth of cultural capacity in their own localities. The unit will cover three related areas: The first situates the creative economy in the various social, economic and political contexts around the world. Creative cultural industries have become crucial to the life of major cities, regional economies and remote areas. Second, creative cultural industries have expanded through travel, international access and changes in the way cities, history, nature, culture, music, food, and art develop into new forms of experiences. Third, students will gain a detailed knowledge of diversity and innovation through the development of their own creative and cultural case studies, making their participation in this unit into an engaging, reflexive and creative experience itself.","Sociology is essential for understanding the turbulence, change, diversity and mobility of the modern world.

It provides the foundation for an understanding of Indonesian culture and society norms, through situating the use of the Indonesian language in relevant social and cultural contexts. Learning the Indonesian language, even as a beginner, cannot be separated from learning the cultural significance in Indonesia of taboos, gestures, the concept of time, and etiquette, all of which are markedly different from Australian cultural norms.","This second-year unit Working with Communities will give
 students in a range of professional disciplines the skills to work effectively
 with diverse communities in their professional practice. The focus is on
 understanding the concept of 'community', cultural differences among, and
 within, communities, and the challenges and opportunities of engaging
 communities in participatory planning and change processes. Regardless of your
 chosen profession, this unit will help you develop the skills required to work
 effectively with diverse communities in a range of contexts in Australia and
 overseas. You will have the opportunity to hear and interact with speakers from
 a range of professional backgrounds and to apply what you learn to a simulated
 professional practice scenario.
 The theory and practice of working with communities have been developed to a
 significant level of sophistication in the fields of community development,
 agricultural extension and rural health. The design of the unit thus draws
 heavily on these three interrelated groups of theoretical insights through a
 partnership among the Institute for Regional Development, the Tasmanian
 Institute of Agriculture and the Centre for Rural Health, with a team of
 interdisciplinary project leaders and advisors. The unit combines a practical
 feel with theoretical rigour; it gives students the opportunity to test and
 apply theory in practice. The unit will be enriched by practice insights from
 professionals working with communities in Australia and overseas, and will
 encourage students to reflect on and analyse their own community experiences.

Forty years of uneven globalisation has been accompanied by the rise of corporations, regional and international institutions, and international nongovernmental agencies. As important influencers of decision-making, these agencies have both undermined and transformed the nation state's position as the key actor in world affairs. Despite national, regional and global intergovernmental and multistakeholder governance efforts, the world remains beset with problems. These range from transnational terrorism, pandemic disease, human rights atrocities, war, weapons of mass destruction and global injustices from deep gender inequality to the dramatic, new and daunting sustainability challenges including of climate change that existing institutions seem ill-equipped to resolve. How should these challenges be met? Can states acting alone solve these old and new global problems as the new populist nationalism appears to believe?
