These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","This unit aims to develop students' ability to deal confidently with the multifaceted challenges facing the function of management accounting in contemporary organisations. The areas covered include: the modern role of management accounting; strategic analysis and planning; operational planning and control; product and service costing; operational and financial budgeting; capital budgeting; and cost-volume profit analysis. Professional practice will be further enhanced through the development of technical and creative skills such as calculations, reporting, analysis and interpretation undertaken using manual methods and Excel spreadsheets.","This unit of study provides students with knowledge and appreciation of the objectives and limitations of an audit, including a theoretical understanding of key auditing principles, concepts and practices, which comprise the audit process.

This unit covers the fundamental accounting concepts and practices, which enable informed management planning and decision making to occur. An analysis framework will be introduced that could be applied to assess an organisation's profitability, liquidity and solvency. Topics include: the concept of Income Statements as a performance report, the Balance Sheet as a statement of financial position, Cash and Accrual Accounting systems, cash flow management, budgeting, internal control cost-volume-price behaviour, and incremental analysis decision making.","As the business environment becomes increasingly data-driven, competency in data analysis and an informed understanding of the business implication of big data becomes a critical skill for managers, corporate consultants and professionals for solving complex problems, strategic decision making and achieving major goals. This unit aims to equip you with the knowledge and skill in collecting and transforming data into meaningful information for harnessing potential insights. You will learn the techniques and principles in data visualization for clear communication of information and reporting, data collection that foster research data integrity, and data processing and analysis that offer insightful and actionable findings. In addition, you will learn to discern data analysis techniques and select the most appropriate technique for your data analysis and for making informed decisions.","This unit develops an evidence-based approach to economic decision-making in a dynamic market environment and critically examines the rationale for and effectiveness of government policy and regulation. Microeconomic topics include an analysis of the competitive environment facing firms, including: pricing, market structure, market failure and transaction costs. Macroeconomic topics include a review of significant national and international economic challenges, including: business cycles, inflation, unemployment and international competitiveness. These will be examined from the perspective of government stabilisation policies and strategies to enhance productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Financial acumen is an important skill for managers in the complex local and global business environment. The unit takes a multidiscipline approach to develop advanced analytical, planning and decision making skills. This unit proposes a theoretical framework for effective and efficient use of financial statement information for business analysis. It identifies and evaluates the key analytical framework components: financial statement, business strategy, accounting, financial, and prospective. This framework is then applied to a variety of complex decision making contexts including security analysis, credit analysis, corporate financing policies analysis, merger and acquisition analysis, and management communications analysis.","This unit aims to critically review the major decisions faced by marketing decision makers in their efforts to harmonize the organization's objectives, capabilities, and resources with marketplace needs and opportunities. This unit allows students to evaluate contemporary practices of marketing: the creation of value for customers and firms and the strategies and methods marketers use to successfully operate in today's dynamic environment. The unit reflects on the major trends in the managerial practice of marketing and the teaching pedagogy is crafted around applied learning content, case study analysis, collaborative decision making and reflective reasoning.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","This unit critically examines the extent to which human resource management is strategic to organizational success in a global context. Alternative models of business strategy and the integration of human resource management are considered. The changing external environment of globalization and competition and the resultant restructuring of industries, labour markets and organizations is analysed so that the factors influencing managerial choice and employee choice in relation to the different strategies can be assessed. There will be a focus on strategic international human resource management and the issues facing organizations that operate in the international environment.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area. This unit of study will explore the principal elements in external and internal environments which impact on organisations and consider how current theoretical frameworks and the interdisciplinary and professional knowledge base respond to complex issues. High level analytical and planning skills will be required to prepare relevant business plans.","1.

Professional practice in the area will be developed through building theoretical knowledge of the use of ERP systems, in conjunction with competency in the practical use an ERP system to facilitate financial and management accounting in contemporary settings. In addition, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, general ledger, financial reporting and management reporting in an ERP system; hardware/software acquisition alternatives; control in an ERP information system, and accounting evaluation of an ERP implementation will be reviewed in relation to various organisations.","This unit provides students with a foundation in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and identifies the key issues for organisations involved in acquiring and maintaining large-scale software systems. The strategic significance of ERP systems in organisations is demonstrated through investigating how ERP systems support business processes, and examining the relationship between the configuration of enterprise systems modules and the design of organisational structures and practices. The objective of the unit is to provide students with sufficient knowledge of ERP systems so that they can appreciate the role and functionality of ERP software as well as being able to contribute effectively in projects for acquiring and enhancing ERP software.","This unit of study investigates knowledge and develops competencies in the management and organisation of information technology suitable for contemporary organisations and ecommerce. A base of critical reviewing the contributions of information technology application in organisational settings will establish contextual understandings of how information technologies permeate many aspects of organisations. The strategic use of information technology will be deconstructed using a range of current IT management topics, which may include information technology planning, business continuity planning/disaster recovery planning, information technology architectures, change management and IT, investment in IT and risk management, network usage policies, organisation of IT, global aspects of IT management, Cloudsourcing, Green IT etc.","Analytics application development have been an essential knowledge concentration of information systems (IS) higher education. Therefore project management skills for such IS development become a sought area of graduate capability development. Analytics project management is indispensable for enhancing planning, scheduling, controlling, monitoring and delivering effective business-specific analytics applications leveraging business decision making in all areas of business operations. 
The unit enables skills and understanding for managing analytics projects, planning and scheduling resources and analysis and acting upon different tasks of an effective analytics systems and management. Reinforcing the importance of a thorough understanding of contemporary project management techniques and the alignments of technical and human factors, the unit equips with both the management of analytics projects and the use of computer software in the management of these and other IT projects.","The unit of study critiques the strategic and organisational issues of process management and the use of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPs) to realise efficient processes. Designing and implementing efficient business processes can provide important strategic advantages for businesses. This unit of study will describe the major strategic approaches' used to understand, analyse and implement efficient business processes. Workflow modelling techniques, process modelling techniques and procedure models will be presented and practiced. SAP S/4 HANA as an example of Enterprise Application Software, will be used to examine the issues that students are likely to encounter in identifying, reorganising and implementing processes in a typical business organisation.","Students will critically review foundational methodologies, techniques and tools that underpin the successful implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. An industry standard system, SAP, will be used to illustrate best practice ERP enterprise integration. This unit overviews issues that need to be considered for successful ERP implementation, challenging students to investigate and interpret on a case-by-case basis critical elements including: the Accelerated SAP (ASAP) Implementation Methodology, data conversion, implementation testing, and monitoring via project reporting. Students will evaluate a range of implementation strategies and alternative change management models to recommend choices for contemporary organisations operating in a variety of business settings.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Customer Relationship Management (CRM) embraces aspects of daily business activities that include marketing, sales and service where customers tend to be directly and regularly engaged. This subject will investigate and explore different aspects of the way that a firm can practice CRM with content potentially developed and drawn from topics that deal with marketing and planning, campaign management, e-marketing, lead management, analytics, customer segmentation, service order support and customer processing. Both theoretical and practice-based content will be critiqued in the subject with student learning being based on using a combination of computer-based exercises, case studies and industry speakers.","Business analytics and visualisation focuses on uncovering business insights hidden in massive datasets using statistical models and algorithms. Visualisation is the vital component of analysing data and communicating insights to stakeholders. The unit equips students with foundational knowledge in business analytics and visualisation to be able to analyse business data, convert insights into business decisions and communicate results to stakeholders. Using open source software (R and Python), students are exposed to a range of business analytics approaches and algorithms, including tidy data presentation, various data wrangling approaches, data storytelling and visualisation basics. Using project workflow and working with real world data, students learn how to work with different datatypes, build and evaluate models, develop data visualisation and communicate insights to stakeholders.","The digital transformation is changing society and is evident all around us. The growing digitisation is setting new standards every day and bringing new challenges to economies, businesses and people. Mobile is now a commodity and has disrupted millions of companies over past decade. People have become used to the speed and simplicity of consumer applications, and so business users expect the same simplicity from our business software. This unit investigates and analyses the impact and issues of adoption of mobile first strategy by organisations. It will focus on the underlying concepts and standards of mobile application development using design thinking principals. Students will critically review emerging issues related to mobile computing and mobile application development, and how agile approach can support current and future business operations.

This unit aims to equip you with the knowledge and skill in collecting and transforming data into meaningful information for harnessing potential insights. You will learn the techniques and principles in data visualization for clear communication of information and reporting, data collection that foster research data integrity, and data processing and analysis that offer insightful and actionable findings. In addition, you will learn to discern data analysis techniques and select the most appropriate technique for your data analysis and for making informed decisions.","This unit develops an evidence-based approach to economic decision-making in a dynamic market environment and critically examines the rationale for and effectiveness of government policy and regulation. Microeconomic topics include an analysis of the competitive environment facing firms, including: pricing, market structure, market failure and transaction costs. Macroeconomic topics include a review of significant national and international economic challenges, including: business cycles, inflation, unemployment and international competitiveness. These will be examined from the perspective of government stabilisation policies and strategies to enhance productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area. This unit of study will explore the principal elements in external and internal environments which impact on organisations and consider how current theoretical frameworks and the interdisciplinary and professional knowledge base respond to complex issues. High level analytical and planning skills will be required to prepare relevant business plans.","The unit applies theoretical and conceptual knowledge to develop creative problem solving of everyday human resource management (HRM) related issues and challenges in the workplace. 
Within the context of broad major current themes and debates in the field, students will critique and dispute concepts and theories which underpin contemporary HRM. Students will use case studies to debate the efficacy of practical techniques, and current models and frameworks used in relation to HRM in organisations.","This unit investigates the nature of industrial relations in Australia and critically reviews the interface between industrial relations institutions, workplaces and employment outcomes. Through analysis, debate and critical reflection, students will exhibit professional attributes of ethical practice, respect for cultural diversity, and consideration of local and global contexts and individual and public good when exploring the complexity of: causes and management of industrial conflict; employment regulation in Australia, management employee relations strategies; the role of unions and governments; industrial tribunals; and enterprise bargaining.","This unit critically examines aspects of employment and industrial law required for highly skilled professional practice in the vocational aspects of HR management and workplace relations. Students will respond to authentic problems, proficiently implementing and adapting the skills necessary to propose optimal solutions to legal problems which may arise in contemporary and emerging workplaces. Critical and creative thinking will inform strategizing techniques and the ability to substantiate or validate innovative resolutions to challenges which may arise in the course of the employment relationship. The unit explores the four main sources of rights and obligations impacting on work arrangements, namely: legislation, industrial instruments, the contract of employment and workplace policies. Key topics include implied duties under the contract of employment; safety net entitlements, collective bargaining, termination of employment; work health and safety; and equal opportunity laws.","This unit develops contemporary understanding of organisational design, organisational change and development through contextualisation of common challenges for change in both traditional and new organisational forms. Students are challenged through interrogation and critical reflection on practices and theories of critical and conventional theories and models of change. Students will advance their diagnostic skills, competencies and processes in assessing the need for change, and the development, implementation, and evaluation of change strategies at all organisational levels. Solutions to complex change management problems will be derived in a socially and culturally responsible manner, where students will advocate and substantiate recommendations grounded in scholarly literature to demonstrate professional responsibility and accountability.","This unit critically examines the extent to which human resource management is strategic to organizational success in a global context. Alternative models of business strategy and the integration of human resource management are considered. The changing external environment of globalization and competition and the resultant restructuring of industries, labour markets and organizations is analysed so that the factors influencing managerial choice and employee choice in relation to the different strategies can be assessed. There will be a focus on strategic international human resource management and the issues facing organizations that operate in the international environment.","This unit of study examines the approaches, strategies, tactics and techniques essential to taking a positive approach to conflict. The Unit will provide an overview of the major developments and issues concerning alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and incorporates important new developments in the field including in neuroscience, affect and conflict theory. The Unit covers the history and development of ADR in Australia and seeks to describe and contextualise all of the key processes.

This unit covers the fundamental accounting concepts and practices, which enable informed management planning and decision making to occur. An analysis framework will be introduced that could be applied to assess an organisation's profitability, liquidity and solvency. Topics include: the concept of Income Statements as a performance report, the Balance Sheet as a statement of financial position, Cash and Accrual Accounting systems, cash flow management, budgeting, internal control cost-volume-price behaviour, and incremental analysis decision making.","As the business environment becomes increasingly data-driven, competency in data analysis and an informed understanding of the business implication of big data becomes a critical skill for managers, corporate consultants and professionals for solving complex problems, strategic decision making and achieving major goals. This unit aims to equip you with the knowledge and skill in collecting and transforming data into meaningful information for harnessing potential insights. You will learn the techniques and principles in data visualization for clear communication of information and reporting, data collection that foster research data integrity, and data processing and analysis that offer insightful and actionable findings. In addition, you will learn to discern data analysis techniques and select the most appropriate technique for your data analysis and for making informed decisions.","This unit develops an evidence-based approach to economic decision-making in a dynamic market environment and critically examines the rationale for and effectiveness of government policy and regulation. Microeconomic topics include an analysis of the competitive environment facing firms, including: pricing, market structure, market failure and transaction costs. Macroeconomic topics include a review of significant national and international economic challenges, including: business cycles, inflation, unemployment and international competitiveness. These will be examined from the perspective of government stabilisation policies and strategies to enhance productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","The purpose of the unit is to provide students with a firm foundation and understanding of business research methods and the research process. Instruction will be provided which will enable students to perform effective literature reviews. Students will be instructed in various research methodologies, the importance of ethical research conduct, and considerations of sampling and fieldwork to assist them with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions drawn.","This unit of study examines the approaches, strategies, tactics and techniques essential to taking a positive approach to conflict. The Unit will provide an overview of the major developments and issues concerning alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and incorporates important new developments in the field including in neuroscience, affect and conflict theory. The Unit covers the history and development of ADR in Australia and seeks to describe and contextualise all of the key processes. It is a comprehensive approach to the subject matter which will enable you to understand and apply the key skills necessary for conflict resolution.","This unit critically examines the extent to which human resource management is strategic to organizational success in a global context. Alternative models of business strategy and the integration of human resource management are considered. The changing external environment of globalization and competition and the resultant restructuring of industries, labour markets and organizations is analysed so that the factors influencing managerial choice and employee choice in relation to the different strategies can be assessed. There will be a focus on strategic international human resource management and the issues facing organizations that operate in the international environment.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","Operations management (OM) is a set of activities that creates value in the form of goods and services by transferring inputs into outputs. The efficient production of these goods and services requires effective applications of concepts, tools and techniques of OM where students will appreciate their importance in improving organisations' productivity. In particular, the focus will be on inventory planning and control, total quality management, scheduling and just in time operations where sales and operations planning justifies their key roles in demand and supply matching. The unit equips students with an understanding of OM at the centre of a supply chain, design of products and processes, strategic approach to cost, quality, delivery and flexibility dimensions, and integrated material requirement planning that make an organisation competitive over others. As the manufacturing is progressively shifting to strategically low cost country locations, the students appreciate the outsourcing strategy, make or buy decision as key to anywhere production, anywhere consumption paradigm. This concept introduces students with Industry 4.0 vision of cyber-physical systems where the autonomous manufacturing is here to lead the way in a global supply chain.","1.

This unit will examine key elements of what constitutes good corporate governance. It will review key regulatory drivers that influence company management, including stock exchange regulation, and consider the main internal control systems necessary to effectively manage contemporary business organisations. It will equip students with knowledge of relevant business rules and regulations. The unit will critically review important areas of company law. Topics covered include: types of companies; corporate personality; company constitutions; contracts made by the company; share capital and loan capital; the duties of directors and managers; and shareholder remedies.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area.

Using open source software (R and Python), students are exposed to a range of business analytics approaches and algorithms, including tidy data presentation, various data wrangling approaches, data storytelling and visualisation basics. Using project workflow and working with real world data, students learn how to work with different datatypes, build and evaluate models, develop data visualisation and communicate insights to stakeholders.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","Green logistics and supply chain management enables a firm to attain its economic targets, minimise environmental hazards, reduce its harmful environmental effects, and enhance the ecological efficiency of the firm and its partners across the supply chain. The unit provides students a comprehensive view of the subject that illustrates the environmental impacts of logistics and the actions that companies can take to deal with them. The unit exposes students to various ways in which freight transport adversely affects the environment, how the impact can be measured and environmental standards can be imposed. In particular, the focus will be on key topics like carbon auditing of supply chains; transferring freight to greener transport modes; reducing the environmental impact of warehousing; improving the energy efficiency of freight transport; making city logistics more environmentally sustainable; and role of government in promoting sustainable logistics. 

The unit takes a strategic perspective of the logistics where students will appreciate the role of environmental metrics in design of freight transport network, location of nodes, choice of transport mode and creation of carbon-neutral warehousing. With the popularity of smart city, the unit covers the establishment of urban consolidation centres and environmental zone that can improve the sustainability of last mile delivery into cities. The unit updates students with the recent development on green logistics such as distribution by drone, 3D printing, physical Internet and concept of ""peak freight"" that have the potential to reduce the impact of logistics on environment.","1.

This degree is designed to equip experienced professionals from diverse industries with sought-after skills. You’ll develop techniques to build innovative teams, drive complex change and adjust quickly to new business conditions. You’ll learn to help individuals appreciate the complexity that surrounds organisational change and strengthen their ability to manage change in their organisations. The course program is developed in collaboration with industry leaders who have enormous change experience who will also contribute towards the delivery of the program. While the program will take an interdisciplinary approach, the key focus will be on blending business and psychology.",director or head of change/ change management professional/consultant/ organisational development consultant/ program/project manager/ ERP/SAP implementation professional/ coaching and training professional.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Financial Analysis,Art and Practice of Leadership,Managing Innovation and Entrepreneurship,Advanced Organisational Behaviour,Organisational Diagnosis and Change,Technological Change and Innovation,Managing Change and Complexity,Strategy and Strategic Change,Business Ethics and Sustainability,Applied Business Project,"Financial acumen is an important skill for managers in the complex local and global business environment. The unit takes a multidiscipline approach to develop advanced analytical, planning and decision making skills. This unit proposes a theoretical framework for effective and efficient use of financial statement information for business analysis. It identifies and evaluates the key analytical framework components: financial statement, business strategy, accounting, financial, and prospective. This framework is then applied to a variety of complex decision making contexts including security analysis, credit analysis, corporate financing policies analysis, merger and acquisition analysis, and management communications analysis.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","This unit investigates theoretical concepts of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship and the skills and competencies to apply this knowledge effectively to diagnoses the need for, identify and leverage an opportunity and create solutions to contemporary business or societal challenges both locally and globally. The unit provides an authentic and evidence based learning experience of the study of the concepts of creativity, innovation, intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship in which learners engage and apply to planning, strategizing and decision making in professional, commercial and social contexts. The unit stimulates students to challenge the way in which entrepreneurs grow within, flourish and are perceived by and contribute to diverse societal contexts and to interpret this understanding to analysing and critiquing contemporary international entrepreneurial trends and dilemmas as responsible ethical and global citizens. Important paradoxes are posed for students to express the way in which human ingenuity translates to business endeavour which can have both positive and negative consequences individuals, societies and nations. Contemporary scenarios and examples are given to enable students to apply developing knowledge to create an entrepreneurial venture that generates economic, social or environmental benefit and which is sustainable.","Organisational behaviour is an interdisciplinary field drawing from numerous disciplines including psychology, sociology, economics, organisation theory, statistics, and several others. This unit of study will expose you to advanced behavioural science theories and applications in management including cognitive theory, psychodynamics and psychoanalysis. It is designed for those who have an interest in understanding, critiquing, and analysing behaviour in organisations. The primary aim of the unit is to improve your understanding of how people behave and interact within organisations.  Having a greater knowledge of employee behaviour will help you understand attitudes and behaviours of your co-workers, subordinates, supervisors, and clients.  Importantly, the unit will help you to better understand your own past and future behaviours as a member and manager (leader) within an organisation and those that's around you. The unit extends beyond the introductory organisational behaviour course by focusing on provocative and current topics including the changing nature of workforce, contracting, consulting, global workforce mobility and knowledge economy.","This unit of study will help students' learn the skills involved in conducting a systemic, organisational diagnosis. The unit specifically places emphasis on systems thinking, psychodynamic organisational theory, and appreciative inquiry as ways into understanding organisational issues and problems. A broader aim is to examine how systems thinking can be incorporated in action research interventions to successfully implement change. The unit intends to provide participants with the theoretical constructs and application skills necessary for identifying and framing problem areas, collecting data, and organising feedback to client systems.  Real-time case examples will inform our discussions as we consider the relationship between diagnosis, organisational reflection, and appropriate action.","The importance of technological change and innovation within organisations has increasingly become critical as firms struggle to achieve and maintain competitive advantage in a fast changing global markets. The speed of technological change has not only brought innovation and efficiency but has also created a challenge for many organisations that still grapple with its complexity. Often the relationship between technological change and organisational change is not comprehended which leads to significant innovations being resisted, became victims to competing ideas, or fail to be sustained. This unit of study will help students learn how new technologies are aligned and implemented within organisations to remain competitive. Using insights from case studies and real life examples, students will be able to analyse problems and challenges relating to technological change and design solutions.","Prescriptions on ""best"" ways to change organizations are in abundance. Yet what most organizations experience when they attempt to change is not as straightforward as the prescriptions suggest. Change, whether internally generated, or externally confronted, is not a neat and clearly marked journey from a present state to a desired state. The complexity that surrounds organisations is not in designing the change journey but in dealing with complex relations with human behaviour. As such, the central debate in the field is, can employee behaviour and attitude be ""managed and controlled"" during change implementation? This unit will focus on the debate and will provide students with an opportunity to critically evaluate and articulate various models of change and help appreciate the complex and paradoxical nature of managing organisational change. Students will have an opportunity to learn from real life case examples that will include both success and failure stories of managing change. Using insights from the case examples, students will be able to analyse problems and challenges relating to managing change in their own organisation.","Rapidly changing global business environments have changed the way in which organisations traditionally developed and implemented corporate strategy. As the world moves towards a knowledge-based economy, senior executives are faced with challenges and contradictions of efficiency versus creativity and exploitation versus exploration when effecting significant strategic change in their organisations. This unit invites students to reflect on the ambiguity and the unpredictability of organisation life and explore the links between strategy development, corporate culture, and managerial action. In addition, the unit provides students with different perspectives on strategy and examines concepts, theoretical frameworks and techniques that are useful in understanding, formulating and implementing successful strategy. It also describes the origins and development of business strategy, the existing strategic paradigms, competing or alternative theoretical frameworks and their implications.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","This unit involves working on an applied business project. Students will apply their skills to a contemporary workplace situation, and deliver recommendations in a business setting. Participants in this unit will be expected to apply a managerial perspective.. The unit provides the opportunity to integrate and apply knowledge from previous units in the course. The integration of work-based learning and academic learning, commonly referred to as Work Integrated Learning (WIL) will allow students to analyse and solve authentic business problems or address real issues faced in organisations. Students will receive feedback on their professional practice.","1.

This unit introduces students to new processes and approaches to the design of digital screens, including mobile devices. Grounded in the context of the research area of user experience (UX), students develop practical skills to create images and 'clickable wireframes'. The unit explores the role of branding in a globalised world where designers need to respond to a variety of communication styles to connect with different audiences. Using a range of case studies, students explore how industry communicates with different demographic groups and critique assumptions made about different groups. The unit covers the latest developments and assesses the viability of trends. Other topics explored include processes to create a design concept, relationship between text and image, handling different file types and employment contexts for designers.","Web technology is at the core of today's entrepreneurial and innovative culture and in this unit we explore how individuals can negotiate current industry contexts, including lean and scrum environments. We explore how to understand and apply knowledge about trends in digital cultures. Focusing initially on the notion of the 'minimal viable product', we generate, manage  and prototype ideas for web technologies in different social settings. The unit will familiarise students with the means and tools to develop digital environments in an era when those with some training, for instance in Javascript and CSS, can co-opt different technologies for their own purposes. We also review topical issues such as content strategy and search engine optimization and keyword research. Students develop their own portfolio website.","Interconnected digital environments create a growing pool of data in the form of web analytics and social network information. In this unit we explore how to harness this data to inform decisions and the methodologies used in industry. This unit reviews use made of such data using case studies from a range of fields. Learning analytics are a form of web analytics gaining importance for students and academics. We review the implications and the 'actionable insights' from this type of data. 

Students will learn about analytical tools available to professionals, in particular, those that measure the performance of digital environments or products. They will learn how such tools inform research into the behaviour of users, product or service developments and improvements in campaign or project outcomes. For instance, we explore how to analyse 'hashtags' in order to inform design and marketing practice. 

The unit is grounded in the consideration of the complexities in the field including those of trust, privacy, and information injustice.","The aim of this unit is to expose students to a range of management issues in the area of new technology design production.  The unit opens with coverage of project management principles relevant to new technology development.  Established and new industry approaches are critically appraised including; agile software development, product release methodology, and content strategy. Issues of intellectual property management are then reviewed. The unit closes with an investigation of employee management in the context of design, for instance, the difference between a producer, project manager and product owner.  In the area of design, often work is completed through teamwork. We discuss the complexities, advantages and disadvantages to this mode.",,,,,,,"1.

This unit introduces students to new processes and approaches to the design of digital screens, including mobile devices. Grounded in the context of the research area of user experience (UX), students develop practical skills to create images and 'clickable wireframes'. The unit explores the role of branding in a globalised world where designers need to respond to a variety of communication styles to connect with different audiences. Using a range of case studies, students explore how industry communicates with different demographic groups and critique assumptions made about different groups. The unit covers the latest developments and assesses the viability of trends. Other topics explored include processes to create a design concept, relationship between text and image, handling different file types and employment contexts for designers.","In this unit, students examine some of the technological developments that have made computer mediated forms of artistic expression and communication possible. Students explore some of the conventions of visual and aural language, techniques for creating digital sound, video ad other forms of moving image. They undertake production and post-production of digital audio and video. Students also storyboard, shoot, digitise and edit video clips and create digital sound effects and sound tracks. Readings cover the history of video and sound technologies, technical theory and technique. The aesthetics of combining audio and video are considered through introductory discussion of film theory.","Web technology is at the core of today's entrepreneurial and innovative culture and in this unit we explore how individuals can negotiate current industry contexts, including lean and scrum environments. We explore how to understand and apply knowledge about trends in digital cultures. Focusing initially on the notion of the 'minimal viable product', we generate, manage  and prototype ideas for web technologies in different social settings. The unit will familiarise students with the means and tools to develop digital environments in an era when those with some training, for instance in Javascript and CSS, can co-opt different technologies for their own purposes. We also review topical issues such as content strategy and search engine optimization and keyword research. Students develop their own portfolio website.","Interconnected digital environments create a growing pool of data in the form of web analytics and social network information. In this unit we explore how to harness this data to inform decisions and the methodologies used in industry. This unit reviews use made of such data using case studies from a range of fields. Learning analytics are a form of web analytics gaining importance for students and academics. We review the implications and the 'actionable insights' from this type of data. 

Students will learn about analytical tools available to professionals, in particular, those that measure the performance of digital environments or products. They will learn how such tools inform research into the behaviour of users, product or service developments and improvements in campaign or project outcomes. For instance, we explore how to analyse 'hashtags' in order to inform design and marketing practice. 

The unit is grounded in the consideration of the complexities in the field including those of trust, privacy, and information injustice.","Digital media is expanding into many areas of everyday life. The use of digital media to support sport and health is a burgeoning area.  Digital media applications are developed for a range of purposes from tackling obesity to improving the strategy of elite sportspeople.  We explore the area through the lens of UX (user experience).  In this unit, we focus on building our skills as UX practitioners.  Different UX methodologies to gain insights into the user's perspective are examined.  Example methodologies include 'personas' and 'user journeys'. The similiarities between UX and the relatively new field of Service Design are reviewed.

Controversial issues in the research field are debated including the sharing of information, and privacy, and designing for motivation. Problems of a technical nature are also addressed, including the development of information 'silos' and the limits of GPS technology.","This unit investigates the notion of cross-platform production, the creation of a digital product that can function across different platforms. We review the elements that create an engaging user experience (ux) and study the fundamentals of 'Persuasive Design'. To create cross-platform projects, practitioners need to know how to create, produce, execute and promote productions. Currently there are industry offers solutions for digital media practitioners to 'co-opt' solutions so that individuals and teams can create their own projects quickly and easily.  In this unit, students have the opportunity to build a game. Students acquire knowledge and experience of cross-media production in the research context of innovation management. Currently this is a burgeoning area in industry that does not have enough specialists who understand the nuances of different mediums.","The aim of this unit is to expose students to a range of management issues in the area of new technology design production.  The unit opens with coverage of project management principles relevant to new technology development.  Established and new industry approaches are critically appraised including; agile software development, product release methodology, and content strategy. Issues of intellectual property management are then reviewed.

As part of this work, pre-service teachers will analyse and debate related research and contemporary issues including transition. Pre-service teachers will utilise pedagogical documentation to build curriculum that is responsive to infant, toddlers, pre-schoolers, school-aged children and families. Connections will be made by illustrating contexts of education and caregiving; vision, strategy, and innovation in curriculum planning with infants and toddlers, pre-schoolers and school-age children; understanding the power of relationships in working with infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, school-aged children, families, and communities; and demonstrating practices and policy development reflective of all children as capable and competent. This unit includes professional experience placements with children aged birth-2 (15 days) and 3-8 years (15 days in the 3-5 age group and 5 days in a primary school F-Yr 2).","Preservice teachers will build their knowledge of how languages are articulated in early childhood centres of Reggio Emilia, Italy as a means for young children to express themselves as human beings. As part of the unit, pre-service teachers will engage with the languages of maths, science, and technology developing an understanding of the structures of each of these languages and how these languages can inspire multi-disciplinary experiences for young children to make meaning of their worlds. Additionally, this unit will interrogate dominant understandings of physical activity and health as defined in policy documents, stage development theories, and curriculum frameworks that teach about movement through concepts of exercise, fitness, movement skills, and physical literacy. This unit focuses on constructing early childhood pedagogies that think with moving, rather than about movement, as pre-service students consider how moving happens in ways that do not fit pre-existing [or inherited] criteria for teaching, understanding, or describing movement. Intentional working with movement through inquiry and wonder offers students an experience in exploring how children move with/in the world, and how this informs teaching and learning that is complex, ethical, and political.","This unit introduces pre-service teachers to the historical and philosophical structures that shape contemporary life. By focusing on the forces that inform these structures, this unit provides pre-service teachers with the conceptual tools necessary to meaningfully situate themselves within the discourse of the history and philosophy of early childhood education. In addition, preservice teachers will engage formally and informally with place as a means of moving towards a reconciled and respectful teaching and learning practices in early childhood settings. Students will formulate an understanding of a diverse range of scholarship and contemporary research paradigms that respond to a range of educational contexts and situations, both locally and globally.","This unit focuses on making meaning through language and literacy when children (including children with English as an additional language) are viewed as capable. Through this perspective, children's approaches to learning are understood as complex, offering ways to build on children's experiences and understandings. Underpinning this unit is the recognition that language and literacy are a social act, representative of power in navigating life. Meaning making in regard to language and literacy includes experiences that hold purpose in rich, thoughtful environments and which include critical and multi-literacy experiences. Language and literacy does not occur as isolated skills, rather as part of how young children express themselves and they are unique to each child.","Preservice teachers will undertake an extended period of professional experience that is the final preparation to enter the teaching profession as activist and critical teachers that enact the broad justice principles of social inclusion and respecting difference. Preservice teachers will undertake 15 days of professional experience in a funded kindergarten program, continuing on from the 10 days undertaken in ECE6007. During the 15 days, preservice teachers will work collaboratively with staff, families and the community. Preservice teachers will articulate and connect their philosophical and theoretical standpoints to generate illustrations of practice in the domains of teaching; Professional Knowledge, Professional Practice and Professional Engagement.","This unit focuses on the languages of aesthetics and poetics from a philosophical perspective. These philosophical understandings inform how languages are articulated in early childhood centres of Reggio Emilia, Italy as a means for young children to express themselves as human beings. As part of the unit, pre-service teachers will engage with the languages of dance, music, and dramatic arts, developing an understanding of the structures of each of these languages and how these languages can inspire multi-disciplinary experiences for young children to make meaning of their worlds. Additionally, this unit will explore art materials as a way to reconsider taken-for-granted responses to materials and ideas in early childhood. Using materials as a mode of inquiry, pre-service teachers will investigate what materials do and how materials are joint participants in early childhood pedagogies. Through critical and reflective material inquiry that includes engaging with place from Aboriginal standpoints, pre-service teachers will examine their own attitudes towards visual and creative arts; develop an understanding of, and skills in, a range of early childhood visual and creative arts and technology experiences; and employ these understandings, attitudes and skills to suit the sociomaterial, sociocultural and aesthetic needs of the young child.","This unit prepares pre-service teachers to lead and manage in early childhood settings. Through the frame of advocacy and activism, pre-service teachers will develop knowledge and skills to work ethically with staff, families and communities within the operational and compliance systems in early childhood settings.","This unit provides an opportunity for pre-service teachers to critically engage as activist reflective practitioners and extend their view of the child as capable in terms of disability, inclusion, and diversity, offering the perspective of children with special rights. This builds on the understanding and acknowledgement that all children have rights (for example, right to be heard, right to contribute, right to learn). This unit examines the rights of children in terms of diversity, equity, and social justice and engages with responsive teaching practices that support inclusion, equity, and diversity. Reviewing related early childhood policy will also be part of the unit, further contributing to curriculum decision-making and foundational understanding of social justice in terms of teacher identity.",,,"1.

The meaning of evaluation and the importance of evaluation goals and objectives are explained and various evaluation models and their appropriate use analysed. The particular evaluation processes that are discussed include experimental, goal oriented, decision-focused, user oriented and responsive evaluation and the basic distinctions between formative (focusing on actual process) and summative evaluation (focusing on final product). The processes for conducting outcome-based evaluations, including the importance of ethics in an evaluation investigation and the methods of data collection and analysis and report writing, are considered.","This unit focuses on innovation and planned change at individual, enterprise and societal levels with a specific emphasis on education in various learning settings, including the workplace and community. It examines values underlying particular innovations and models and strategies for developing, promoting, disseminating and implementing change and factors affecting adoption and institutionalisation. 'Innovation' is synonymous with change and how people and organisations address change is incorporated into the study. The unit includes: the purposes and goals of innovation; theories that inform a culture of innovation; values underpinning change; change and innovation at individual, local, organisational and global levels; strategies for developing innovative education and training practices; professional development models for transformation; strategies for developing communities of inquiry and professional learning teams; case studies of innovation in community learning settings, workplaces and educational and training institutions.","In this unit of study students explore a wide range of fundamental theories of learning, following the development of learning and teaching through the 20th and early 21st Century. These ideas are considered for relevance in the present day contexts, and personal histories, of the participants. Through a process of analysis, comparison and prediction based on the various learning theories and perspectives, participants will construct a stronger understanding of the process of learning, and the role of the teacher, with particular consideration of 21st century learning requirements and the use of emergent technologies.","Students will apply the process of teaching and learning in an online learning environment, evaluating effective online communications technologies, working with online classroom dynamics, comparing learning management systems, producing e-learning content, and investigating emerging trends of e-learning in educational settings. The unit will investigate the dynamic congruence of teaching and learning pedagogies in using e-learning technologies and flexible delivery.","This unit of study addresses issues of wellbeing in the context of educational settings. The focus of the unit is to investigate the factors that contribute to the ability of individuals, groups and organisations to flourish. The unit will draw on a range of research findings from the discipline of Positive Psychology (Seligman et al.) and examine their applications in educational settings. The unit will offer participants the opportunity to explore a range of topics contributing to wellbeing including resilience, flow, positive emotions, happiness, self-esteem and self-efficacy, beliefs as self-fulfilling prophecies, the pitfalls of perfectionism, goal setting and the use of character strengths. Students will explore these themes in practical ways related to their own educational contexts.","This unit of study will include consideration of the social and cultural contexts that influence curriculum and pedagogy in education and training settings. Theoretical and practical considerations will be drawn upon to investigate and critique how political, economic, social and cultural factors surround and infuse curriculum and pedagogy. Ways to develop socially just curriculum and pedagogy, and the grounds for doing so, will be explored with specific reference to how the intended is not necessarily the actual curriculum in settings of practice. Pedagogical practices to engage students across a range of social contexts, including active participation by teachers, students and parents in curriculum review and development processes, will be an integral component in considering both the theory and practice of education for social justice.","In this unit of study students enhance their skills and knowledge by exploring a particular field of education and/or training that they regard as directly related to their own interests. Through negotiation with a mentor, students identify a particular theoretical and/or professional interest they have and then embark on a guided, largely independent in-depth critical study related to their interest. Students have a level of independence and flexibility in how they construct and present their learning.

A historical overview of colonial education provides students with critical language and concepts to make connections to national empire building and the production of colonial identities in compulsory schooling, early childhood education, vocational, adult and higher education. Students investigate how previous colonies of the European empires have sought independence, with focus on post-colonial and Indigenous theorists' descriptions of challenges in decolonising teaching and learning. Considering the key issues of self-determination, sovereignty and the rights of colonised and Indigenous peoples in education, students explore the production of pedagogical and curriculum materials that have embedded Indigenous and post-colonial ways of knowing and knowledge.

In doing so, they draw on theory, knowledge and skills developed through their degree. Through negotiation with their lecturer, students undertake a review of relevant literature, by applying appropriate selection criteria for choosing and analysing the literature. Students independently produce an evidence-based research report. The report demonstrates skilfulness in engaging in systematic processes of inquiring into a relevant topic.","In this unit, students independently conduct research which demonstrates their ability to define a problem, undertake a detailed literature search and review the relevant theoretical and practical literature. Students develop a methodology and apply it to an appropriate problem or situation. They also demonstrate good data selection, collection and analysis skills to inform their problem or situation, and the capacity to respond to academic feedback. Developing the minor thesis, or negotiated alternative, involves a high standard of written communication skills.  Each student has a supervisor who provides individual support.","In this unit, the first of two units in which part-time minor thesis students enrol, students independently conduct research which demonstrates their ability to define a problem, undertake a detailed literature search and review the relevant theoretical and practical literature.

Various models of project management and related principles and methodologies will be appraised. Frameworks for working in a project team environment will also be proposed and evaluated.","The Project Planning and Control unit will review the development process of a project from its inception through to feasibility and commencement. Design documentation, procurement commissioning and life cycle planning will all be addressed. Theoretical frameworks for planning and managing the project management process will be critiqued. Project control and cost planning, financial control, time management and other scheduling techniques will be applied to practical scenarios.","Successful projects comprise several key features. One is the 'people' factor. Good project outcomes rely on both strong leadership and management skills which include the explicit specification and understanding of requisite roles, responsibilities, skills and effort of project participants. Project Management and People identifies and critically assesses the qualities of people working on projects and extrapolates how they can contribute to project success in a diversity of known and uncertain contexts. The subject also explores how human behaviour in project-focused organisations differs from that in more traditional organisational forms. The evidence base of theoretical and translational approaches to people management is reviewed and critiqued.","Internal and external stakeholders have a key role to play in the success or otherwise of a project. Stakeholders range from multinational organisations to communities, individuals and government authorities. 

This unit critically reviews traditional and emerging stakeholder management theories in order to investigate how they apply to contemporary project scenarios both in Australia and internationally. Students will learn how to identify and engage project stakeholders, prioritise their importance and evaluate their potential and actual contribution to project success. The relationship between the role of project manager and the expectations and perspectives of diverse stakeholders is also considered.","In this course, participants will develop the requisite knowledge and skills to identify and classify complex aspects of risk management within a project. Project teams will learn how to plan, control and review risks associated with a project and develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies.

The unit addresses the conduct of control activities in accordance with the ISO 31000: 2009 Standard and other relevant industry-based Risk Management Standards.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area. This unit of study will explore the principal elements in external and internal environments which impact on organisations and consider how current theoretical frameworks and the interdisciplinary and professional knowledge base respond to complex issues. High level analytical and planning skills will be required to prepare relevant business plans.","The Fundamentals of Cyber Security unit covers the importance of cybersecurity, the most common risks, and how to mitigate them. Students in this unit will learn about cyber security and how it is related to the industry growth. This unit introduces the basic cyber security concepts and the common architectures used as industry standards. Students will have an opportunity to study different types of malware and the potential attack vectors, including viruses, trojans and ransomware; and use network and system tools to manage security issues and maintain a safe working environment. Students will be introduced to contemporary information technologies related to network security, such as cryptography and block chain, to secure interactions.","Enterprise computer networks may be vulnerable to both inside and outside threats.  Enterprise networks including Internet access, intranets, extranets and various business activities must be protected. Enterprise needs to manage and control security policies choosing from hundreds of available security rules. Within the network infrastructure, security protection software including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus detection systems, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions. Important corporate information may be distributed across a variety of different systems. Networks have security point products - often from various vendors - with different security attributes and settings. Administrators are faced with the task of Enterprise Security Management such as coordination, implementation and monitoring of security attributes across varied, dispersed infrastructures. The dynamic nature of corporate networks means that they are no longer defined by physical boundaries, but instead by enterprise-wide security policies.","1.

MST,Victoria University,Footscray Park,Master of International Community Development,College of Arts and Education,"12,000",,AUD,Year,2,Years,IELTS,,,6.5,,,https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/international/AMCD,English,A,"Become a leader in social change, human rights and sustainable development at a global or local level, with the Master of International Community Development. This unique, popular program offers you a personalised education. It includes practical on-site learning and deep engagement with communities and experts in the field. The perfect mix of study and practical experience will have you job-ready for a fulfilling career. Key study areas include:","international and regional consultant in human rights, gender, poverty reduction and project evaluation/ project manager with international, government and local organisations such as Australian Red Cross, Save the Children, Asylum Seekers Resources Centre/ leaders and advisers in government/ community development educator and trainer/ journalist/ activist/ academic and researcher.",Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Research Methods,Community Development: Theory and Practice,Community Development: Project Planning and Management,Transnational Gender Issues and Human Rights,Building Capacity and Mobilising Civil Society,Conflict Resolution in Groups and Communities,Community-Based Research (Part 1),Community-Based Research (Part 2),Research Thesis (Part 1),Research Thesis (Part 2),"This unit of study covers a variety of research methods relevant to research in a community development or digital media context. The ontological and epistemological foundations to various approaches to social research will be critically reviewed. Students will become broadly familiar with the concepts of logic and methodology and quantitative and qualitative research methods. They will be able to select a research topic(s), design research proposal(s) and adopt appropriate research methods. To emphasis skills development in research training, students will practice with (and use) commonly used social research software tools.","This unit critically reviews a variety of contemporary community development perspectives. The focus is upon understanding the context of international social, economic and political development. Students will critique how they understand their own location and how their views have been shaped by the dominant economic paradigm. The unit focuses also on various development frameworks and their stance regarding environmental sustainability, equality and human rights.  Further, the unit engages learners in a self-critique as global players in development and social change. Students interrogate practices in poverty reduction, marginalisation, community organisation and conscientisation, to develop clarity of their own praxis.","This unit of study focuses on project planning and design for community development work in a development setting. The principles of project design are examined and debated in relation to their role and application to international community development work. Students will investigate and selectively apply methodologies and techniques used in project work and its evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on participatory approaches such as Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), and the impact of gender on outcomes and development strategies. Students will critically review culturally relevant project monitoring, reporting and evaluation methodologies.","This unit explores how gender is deeply embedded in the ways we define our world and act within it, how our bodies are regulated and surveilled and hence how power enters into both the enhancement and suppression of capabilities through definitions of gendered bodies and their interactions and intersections. The gendered dimension is considered from a global perspective through the lens of human rights and how the latter attempt to intersect some traditional modes of gendered identities and interactions by injecting questions about opportunities and outcomes of a social, political, economic or cultural nature. All of this is then disseminated and applied to the work of development and community development.","This unit of study critiques key developments and debates about civil society, its history and evolving roles and functions in international community development. Students examine civil society's relationships with other actors, including other civil society organisations (CSOs), governments, international institutions and the private sector. They will critically assess the relationships between civil society in developed and developing countries, including in relation to supporting capacity building of Indigenous civil society to mobilise communities to claim rights, hold governments and authorities to account, connect communities and representatives, and plan and implement community development initiatives. Students interrogate the concept of capacity development and its relationship to processes of self-determination, democratisation and state development and consider the appropriateness and sustainability of capacity development strategies. Case studies are used to provide real world illustrations of key issues and tensions.","This unit of study debates the application of conflict resolution theory to conflicts at both group and community levels. Through this process a sophisticated, multi-layered definition of the nature of conflict will be derived. Specific processes and skills for resolving or managing conflict in a range of differing contexts are then considered, including: individual conflicts, multi-party and multi-issue conflicts, intragroup conflicts, cultural and intergroup conflicts, and disputes in neighbourhood and workplace contexts. Particular emphasis will be placed on the awareness of difference and its effect in disputes, and on the students' own styles in dealing with conflict.","This unit is the first Community-Based Research unit, which is followed by Community Based Research (Part 2) Students are required to enter into a Work Integrated Learning (WIL) contract relating to a community development project or program in an agency. The contract is negotiated between the university supervisor, agency supervisor and student, and specifies learning objectives and strategies in three areas: conceptual and policy; practical skills; and personal development. Students are required to participate in a number of key phases and activities of the program or project and write an assignment that outlines the processes and outcomes of the project.","The unit is the second Community-Based Research unit. Students are required to enter into a Work Integrated Learning (WiL) contract relating to a community development project or program in an agency. The contract is negotiated between the university supervisor, agency supervisor and student, and specifies learning objectives and strategies in three areas: conceptual and policy; practical skill; and personal development. Students are required to participate in a number of key phases and activities of the program or project and write a major report on their project.","This unit of study is the first part of the Research Thesis and provides students the opportunity, under guidance from a supervisor, to develop a research question and write a thesis on topics related to community development or digital media. The final topic will be negotiated between the student and supervisor and will be a research area within the field of community development or digital media either in Australian and/or international context.  The research will usually be text-based, but may include  fieldwork to gather data. The student who undertakes fieldwork must demonstrate a high-level knowledge of ethical fieldwork procedures and seek timely ethics approval.","This unit of study follows Research Thesis (Part 1) and provides students the opportunity, under guidance from a supervisor, to progress in the research process and management. Further to developing a research question and designing the study with an ethics process, the learner will undertake data analysis and its management, and draft the study report which goes to the final thesis. Students, undertaking creative/practical work, can include their project work with the word count. This is an opportunity for learners to demonstrate they are able to conduct ethical studies in the domains of field, practical/creative, communications research report and interpret the findings and communicate them to various audiences. Again, this part of the research thesis aligns with AQF standards at this level and is deemed as contributing towards a ready practitioner embedded in a community of practice.","1.

Gain the skills needed to manage project teams and lead change with the Master of Management. This course focuses on managing people, systems and projects in today’s global organisations. It allows graduates to build on their qualifications with specialised expertise. Management study areas include:",learning and development or HR development/ change management or organisation development/ leadership roles in innovation and business sustainability.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Business Ethics and Sustainability,Business Research Methods,Managing Workplace Conflict,Strategic Human Resource Management,Art and Practice of Leadership,Operations Management,Strategic Management and Business Policy,Managing Innovation and Entrepreneurship,Organisation Change Management,Business Research Project,"This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","The purpose of the unit is to provide students with a firm foundation and understanding of business research methods and the research process. Instruction will be provided which will enable students to perform effective literature reviews. Students will be instructed in various research methodologies, the importance of ethical research conduct, and considerations of sampling and fieldwork to assist them with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions drawn.","This unit of study examines the approaches, strategies, tactics and techniques essential to taking a positive approach to conflict. The Unit will provide an overview of the major developments and issues concerning alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and incorporates important new developments in the field including in neuroscience, affect and conflict theory. The Unit covers the history and development of ADR in Australia and seeks to describe and contextualise all of the key processes. It is a comprehensive approach to the subject matter which will enable you to understand and apply the key skills necessary for conflict resolution.","This unit critically examines the extent to which human resource management is strategic to organizational success in a global context. Alternative models of business strategy and the integration of human resource management are considered. The changing external environment of globalization and competition and the resultant restructuring of industries, labour markets and organizations is analysed so that the factors influencing managerial choice and employee choice in relation to the different strategies can be assessed. There will be a focus on strategic international human resource management and the issues facing organizations that operate in the international environment.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","Operations management (OM) is a set of activities that creates value in the form of goods and services by transferring inputs into outputs. The efficient production of these goods and services requires effective applications of concepts, tools and techniques of OM where students will appreciate their importance in improving organisations' productivity. In particular, the focus will be on inventory planning and control, total quality management, scheduling and just in time operations where sales and operations planning justifies their key roles in demand and supply matching. The unit equips students with an understanding of OM at the centre of a supply chain, design of products and processes, strategic approach to cost, quality, delivery and flexibility dimensions, and integrated material requirement planning that make an organisation competitive over others. As the manufacturing is progressively shifting to strategically low cost country locations, the students appreciate the outsourcing strategy, make or buy decision as key to anywhere production, anywhere consumption paradigm. This concept introduces students with Industry 4.0 vision of cyber-physical systems where the autonomous manufacturing is here to lead the way in a global supply chain.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area. This unit of study will explore the principal elements in external and internal environments which impact on organisations and consider how current theoretical frameworks and the interdisciplinary and professional knowledge base respond to complex issues. High level analytical and planning skills will be required to prepare relevant business plans.","This unit investigates theoretical concepts of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship and the skills and competencies to apply this knowledge effectively to diagnoses the need for, identify and leverage an opportunity and create solutions to contemporary business or societal challenges both locally and globally. The unit provides an authentic and evidence based learning experience of the study of the concepts of creativity, innovation, intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship in which learners engage and apply to planning, strategizing and decision making in professional, commercial and social contexts. The unit stimulates students to challenge the way in which entrepreneurs grow within, flourish and are perceived by and contribute to diverse societal contexts and to interpret this understanding to analysing and critiquing contemporary international entrepreneurial trends and dilemmas as responsible ethical and global citizens. Important paradoxes are posed for students to express the way in which human ingenuity translates to business endeavour which can have both positive and negative consequences individuals, societies and nations. Contemporary scenarios and examples are given to enable students to apply developing knowledge to create an entrepreneurial venture that generates economic, social or environmental benefit and which is sustainable.","This unit develops contemporary understanding of organisational design, organisational change and development through contextualisation of common challenges for change in both traditional and new organisational forms. Students are challenged through interrogation and critical reflection on practices and theories of critical and conventional theories and models of change. Students will advance their diagnostic skills, competencies and processes in assessing the need for change, and the development, implementation, and evaluation of change strategies at all organisational levels. Solutions to complex change management problems will be derived in a socially and culturally responsible manner, where students will advocate and substantiate recommendations grounded in scholarly literature to demonstrate professional responsibility and accountability.","The project provides students with the opportunity, either individually or in teams to apply an advanced body of knowledge and skills to an approved, consultancy-based task. Proposals for projects will normally be developed in conjunction with the unit of study Business Research Methods (BMO6630). Each project should lead to business innovations or potential entrepreneurship development. Research may include analysis and anticipation of user or business needs; business scenario development and business case studies; the study of existing business practices and solutions, and innovative business models development.","1.

Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","The purpose of the unit is to provide students with a firm foundation and understanding of business research methods and the research process. Instruction will be provided which will enable students to perform effective literature reviews. Students will be instructed in various research methodologies, the importance of ethical research conduct, and considerations of sampling and fieldwork to assist them with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions drawn.","The unit critically reviews many facets of electronic marketing with particular reference to its application for direct marketing and online advertising. Students will engage with the unit material through an established framework for an electronic marketing plan so that they will be able to utilise their theoretical knowledge and understanding on how to deploy digital technology to stay competitive in a dynamic business environment. Students will plan, evaluate and implement electronic marketing strategies including the use of social media to transform traditional marketing and business models.","This unit critically examines managerial decision-making skills in all aspects of promotion through the praxis of theoretical propositions and contemporary professional practice. The challenges of strategy development and implementation in advertising will be addressed through a variety of lenses: personal selling, publicity, public relations, direct response marketing and customer service. Critical examination and challenges will be informed by analysis and theorising about developments that contribute to enhanced professional practice and scholarship in this dynamic field of study.","Customer Relationship Management (CRM) embraces aspects of daily business activities that include marketing, sales and service where customers tend to be directly and regularly engaged. This subject will investigate and explore different aspects of the way that a firm can practice CRM with content potentially developed and drawn from topics that deal with marketing and planning, campaign management, e-marketing, lead management, analytics, customer segmentation, service order support and customer processing. Both theoretical and practice-based content will be critiqued in the subject with student learning being based on using a combination of computer-based exercises, case studies and industry speakers.","This unit provides students with a systematic approach to evaluate and apply advanced marketing frameworks, concepts and methods to make strategic marketing decisions that sustain a broader corporate strategy. The unit is presented in a critical manner, ensuring students contextualise theoretical propositions, and the use of evidence-based corroboration which allow the student to use empirical knowledge to develop the most appropriate strategies in practice. The focus will be to develop and design marketing strategy within the scope of a company's overall objectives.","This interdisciplinary unit discusses the consumer as the focus of the marketing system. The unit of study emphasises the use of knowledge about consumer behaviour in marketing decisions and insight for innovation. The contribution of the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, psychology, and economics to the understanding of consumer buying behaviour is highlighted. Specific area of focus are consumer needs, motives, perceptions, attitudes, personality, the socialisation process, group influences (family, social groups, culture and business) and culture.  Theoretical and conceptual consumer behaviour frameworks are applied to purchasing decision-making, buying and the use of goods and services in both Australian and a global context.","The project provides students with the opportunity, either individually or in teams to apply an advanced body of knowledge and skills to an approved, consultancy-based task. Proposals for projects will normally be developed in conjunction with the unit of study Business Research Methods (BMO6630). Each project should lead to business innovations or potential entrepreneurship development. Research may include analysis and anticipation of user or business needs; business scenario development and business case studies; the study of existing business practices and solutions, and innovative business models development.","The Business Research Proposal provides students with an opportunity to apply and modify investigative, analytical and critical skills gained and developed through the coursework units to the resolution of a business problem. Established theories to different bodies of knowledge or practice will be critiqued in the context of a scoped investigation contextualised to a specified community/organisation in an ethical and socially responsible manner.  The research proposal provides the preliminary stages of the research for the completion of the minor thesis. Students will also complete an Ethics Application form to be assessed by the University's Ethics Committee. The thesis topic must be approved by the course co-ordinator.","The unit of study is aimed at introducing graduate students to aspects related to the branding of products and services in the marketplace. It will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary in developing and administering policies and strategies for both the company's existing and new products with a competitive edge.  The unit examines brands and their growing importance, consumers and brands, and what marketing executives need to do to manage brands strategically. More specifically, the unit incorporates key issues such as: measuring, managing and maintaining brand equity, brand positioning, strategic brand management, the role of marketing communications in creating a brand, co-branding, strategic alliances, managing brands over time, global brand management, services branding, and branding in the digital era.","1.

In Module 1, participants will identify the roles of players and stakeholders engaged in specific projects and the interactions between them. Project management processes will be considered at both theoretical and applied levels (using authentic industry-based scenarios drawing on students' existing knowledge and experience). In Module 2, participants will study project initiation, development of a project charter, scoping and network analysis, time management, cost management and quality management. In Module 3 participants will work collaboratively within a simulated project environment and investigate the impact of human behaviour and group dynamics in project management. A key feature of the unit is the critique of the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge) framework.","The Project Planning and Control unit will review the development process of a project from its inception through to feasibility and commencement. Design documentation, procurement commissioning and life cycle planning will all be addressed. Theoretical frameworks for planning and managing the project management process will be critiqued. Project control and cost planning, financial control, time management and other scheduling techniques will be applied to practical scenarios.",Project management applies those technical and human skills that lead to project success. Project governance is the system and framework that ensures project decisions are made in alignment with the organisational governance policies and procedures. This unit of study will allow students to identify and develop processes through which a project governance framework can be set up and applied to projects in any organisation. This will involve a practical application of the principles on a project where the project governance framework is analysed for its ability to prevent project failure.,"Successful projects comprise several key features. One is the 'people' factor. Good project outcomes rely on both strong leadership and management skills which include the explicit specification and understanding of requisite roles, responsibilities, skills and effort of project participants. Project Management and People identifies and critically assesses the qualities of people working on projects and extrapolates how they can contribute to project success in a diversity of known and uncertain contexts. The subject also explores how human behaviour in project-focused organisations differs from that in more traditional organisational forms. The evidence base of theoretical and translational approaches to people management is reviewed and critiqued.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","This unit investigates theoretical concepts of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship and the skills and competencies to apply this knowledge effectively to diagnoses the need for, identify and leverage an opportunity and create solutions to contemporary business or societal challenges both locally and globally. The unit provides an authentic and evidence based learning experience of the study of the concepts of creativity, innovation, intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship in which learners engage and apply to planning, strategizing and decision making in professional, commercial and social contexts. The unit stimulates students to challenge the way in which entrepreneurs grow within, flourish and are perceived by and contribute to diverse societal contexts and to interpret this understanding to analysing and critiquing contemporary international entrepreneurial trends and dilemmas as responsible ethical and global citizens. Important paradoxes are posed for students to express the way in which human ingenuity translates to business endeavour which can have both positive and negative consequences individuals, societies and nations. Contemporary scenarios and examples are given to enable students to apply developing knowledge to create an entrepreneurial venture that generates economic, social or environmental benefit and which is sustainable.","This unit develops contemporary understanding of organisational design, organisational change and development through contextualisation of common challenges for change in both traditional and new organisational forms. Students are challenged through interrogation and critical reflection on practices and theories of critical and conventional theories and models of change. Students will advance their diagnostic skills, competencies and processes in assessing the need for change, and the development, implementation, and evaluation of change strategies at all organisational levels. Solutions to complex change management problems will be derived in a socially and culturally responsible manner, where students will advocate and substantiate recommendations grounded in scholarly literature to demonstrate professional responsibility and accountability.","Project, Program and Portfolio Management (PPPM) will introduce students to senior management decision-making models. Portfolio management involves prioritisation, risk assessment and deployment of resources across an entire organisation to achieve benefits to the whole-of-business. In contrast, program management identifies benefits and realises outcomes across programs and projects. PPPM concentrates on the development of a realistic picture of an organisation's business and future strategy and how to best use company resources to achieve beneficial results. These resources include adopting standards across an enterprise, developing staff competency through education and training, and implementing reporting regimes to provide senior management with information for sound decision making. Program Management feeds into portfolio decision making by providing accurate and real-time data, quality assurance across programs and projects and ensuring consistent processes are maintained.","This unit is designed to provide an understanding of the principles of project management practice and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and others in a project team. Utilising the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge). Guide as a reference, the unit explores 10 Knowledge Areas in project management and instigates the process of applying these to contemporary and emerging project environments. The unit delivers a comprehensive understanding of how due diligence manifests in a project life cycle. It addresses what is to be delivered in a project (scope), how it is to be delivered (plan), the delivery and implementation (execution) and finally reporting and review. Theoretical models are proposed which integrate sustainable methods into the fabric of projects and operations and align project and business outcomes with organisational strategic goals.","1.

MST,Victoria University,Footscray Park,Master of Project Management,College of Engineering and Science,"16,100",,AUD,Year,2,Years,IELTS,,,6.5,,,https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/international/NMPM,English,A,Gain a diverse and in-demand skill set for a rewarding career when you study the Master of Project Management. This course is specifically designed for current and potential project managers in industry. It equips you with advanced project management principles and techniques which can be applied across various industries. You can apply the project management skills you learn during this course to projects in sectors including:,construction managers/ engineering managers/ ICT managers.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Fundamentals of Project Management,Project Governance,Project Management and People,Research Methods,Principles of Project Management,Project Planning and Control,Research Project Part A,Research Project Part B,Research Thesis 1,Art and Practice of Leadership,"This unit comprises three modules. In Module 1, participants will identify the roles of players and stakeholders engaged in specific projects and the interactions between them. Project management processes will be considered at both theoretical and applied levels (using authentic industry-based scenarios drawing on students' existing knowledge and experience). In Module 2, participants will study project initiation, development of a project charter, scoping and network analysis, time management, cost management and quality management. In Module 3 participants will work collaboratively within a simulated project environment and investigate the impact of human behaviour and group dynamics in project management. A key feature of the unit is the critique of the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge) framework.",Project management applies those technical and human skills that lead to project success. Project governance is the system and framework that ensures project decisions are made in alignment with the organisational governance policies and procedures. This unit of study will allow students to identify and develop processes through which a project governance framework can be set up and applied to projects in any organisation. This will involve a practical application of the principles on a project where the project governance framework is analysed for its ability to prevent project failure.,"Successful projects comprise several key features. One is the 'people' factor. Good project outcomes rely on both strong leadership and management skills which include the explicit specification and understanding of requisite roles, responsibilities, skills and effort of project participants. Project Management and People identifies and critically assesses the qualities of people working on projects and extrapolates how they can contribute to project success in a diversity of known and uncertain contexts. The subject also explores how human behaviour in project-focused organisations differs from that in more traditional organisational forms. The evidence base of theoretical and translational approaches to people management is reviewed and critiqued.","Effective management of successful projects is founded on a broad evidence-base. While evidence can be extracted from the disciplinary literature, existing databases or previous project experience, original research may also be undertaken to meet the requirements of a specific project. Research is a process of enquiry and investigation, and takes a systematic and methodical approach to the creation of knowledge-as-evidence. Ineffective decision making can occur when a lack of knowledge leads to project delay and failure. 

Research Methods guides participants through the logical steps required for the establishment of a project management research proposal for a professional project or further scholarship. Starting with an overview of the purpose of research, it develops a set of principles designed to build a research proposal based on conceptual issues and different approaches to research design. The collection and review of data, the application of qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies, the analysis of data, reporting of results and conclusion are all considered.","The unit of study will introduce and define project management as it applies to the conceptualisation, design, development, documentation, procurement and maintenance of any project or facilities (including buildings, infrastructure and IT). Various models of project management and related principles and methodologies will be appraised. Frameworks for working in a project team environment will also be proposed and evaluated.","The Project Planning and Control unit will review the development process of a project from its inception through to feasibility and commencement. Design documentation, procurement commissioning and life cycle planning will all be addressed. Theoretical frameworks for planning and managing the project management process will be critiqued. Project control and cost planning, financial control, time management and other scheduling techniques will be applied to practical scenarios.","This unit provides an opportunity for students to undertake research in a specialised area relevant to their own area of work or interest and/or related to theories explored in their master degree study. The unit provides students with a firm foundation from which they can undertake a research problem. The requirements of this unit have been developed to enhance students' theoretical application in problem solving, communication skills, individual and group project participation and other professional capabilities necessary for their degree. Students will apply and synthesise knowledge and skills to develop an in-depth understanding of managing projects in contemporary and emergent settings. They will apply knowledge and technical skills to the investigation of a contemporary research problem, thereby making a contribution to the disciplinary evidence-base research. A final report of approximately 8000 words should be submitted at the end of the project

The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","1.

Globalisation, climate change and demographic transition have led to shifts in health needs all over the world. This course has been developed to prepare health professionals to be ready and able to respond to these changes. Uniquely, this course focuses on both global nutrition and active living in diverse communities, from both an Australian and international perspective.","global health, nutrition, physical activity research and teaching/ community development work in health, nutrition and food security/ delivering health, food and nutrition programs in response to emergencies/ health policy development/ program planning, development and evaluation/ specific population focused health interventions (e.g. older adults, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, chronically diseased populations)/ inclusive physical activity programming/ physical activity and sedentary behaviour measurement.",Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Foundations of Public Health,Epidemiology,Global Challenge - Non-Communicable Disease,Nutrition for Global Health,Public Health in Practice,Biostatistics,Culture and Society in Public Health,Global Food Systems and Food Security,Nutrition Assessment and Program Management,Migration and Health,"This unit is designed to introduce students to the main theories, principles and values of public health illustrated by selected major topics from a global perspective. It investigates policy, systematic and multi-discipline public health approaches as a global and local effort to address contemporary health challenges. The origins and evolution of public health and major global achievements in public health and their impact on health of populations are explored. The role and interface of political, cultural, social, behavioural and environmental determinants of health of populations informs critique and discussion throughout the unit.","This unit examines the epidemiological approaches that are used to understand the health of populations and to inform disease control measures, with a focus on global nutrition and active living. Students learn the principles and concepts of descriptive epidemiology used to study the distribution of disease in a population. They also develop skills in analytical epidemiology to investigate the determinants and effects of disease and other health conditions.","Non-communicable diseases are emerging as a major challenge to global health and development. In this unit students will investigate and critique responses to the non-communicable disease epidemic through public health interventions. Trends in non-communicable diseases and their impact globally, including in low and middle-income countries will be analysed. The determinants of non-communicable diseases and the challenges faced in researching and controlling these conditions will be viewed through the lens of nutrition and active living. . The consequences of non-communicable diseases on the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities and their effect on national economic growth and development is examined.","This unit provides an overview of current and emerging global nutrition challenges from a biological, social, economic and policy perspective. Focusing on low and middle income countries the unit explores issues of maternal and child under-nutrition and the growing global momentum to address these with evidence-based interventions delivered to scale. The double-burden of nutrition related diseases as a result of changing food consumption and physical activity levels is increasingly becoming a major public health concern globally with an increase in non-communicable diseases in low and middle income countries. Building on the unit Global Challenge: Non-Communicable Disease, this unit explores specific issues around the double burden of nutrition-related communicable and non-communicable disease and recent advances in efforts to tackle this globally.","This unit explores how public health theories, principles and values have informed the practice of public health with a focus on program planning for health promotion. The origins and purpose of health promotion and the theories which inform health promotion practice are examined along with the potential of health promotion to positively influence the determinants of health and reduce health inequalities. Students will gain skills in a range of practical approaches and methods for promoting health. Students will use a project management cycle to assess needs, set priorities for action and plan and manage interventions that promote health in populations. Theoretical aspects of the unit will be reinforced through their application to local, national and global issues.","This unit introduces students to the fundamental concepts of biostatistics and fundamental statistical methods used in public health research. Focusing on global nutrition and active living students learn how to apply statistical methods to research questions, how to use statistical software to perform a range of statistical analyses and how to appraise statistical methods described and applied in the public health literature.","This unit examines the contribution of the social sciences to understanding and improving public health. The influence of culture and society on beliefs, attitudes and behaviours around health and how these shape disease risk and health outcomes is critically appraised. Students will explore the complex relationships between gender, culture and health inequalities. The efficacy of policies and strategies to address such inequalities will be evaluated. Concepts of cultural competence and its relevance to public health practice and cross cultural communication models are examined to facilitate enhanced professional practice when working with diverse communities.","Food security is defined by the World Health Organization as ""when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life"". This unit introduces students to global food systems and the challenges of ensuring food security for all in a world of climate change, globalization, shifting demographics and new technologies. The different nature of food insecurity in high, middle and low income countries will be explored focusing on the relationships between food security, health, nutrition and social stability. In rural communities in low income countries food insecurity is still a problem despite proximity to agricultural land. This unit will investigate food security assessment methodologies and how these are used in conjunction with nutrition assessment as part of a community needs assessment. Sustainable agriculture and food security interventions that address identified needs and aim to reduce levels of under nutrition in the community will be covered. The role of women in food security is integral to the unit.","This unit covers assessment of the nutritional status of individuals and populations using anthropometric, clinical, dietary and biochemical methods. The use and limitations of each of these methods is critically appraised both in terms of their measurement at the individual level and their application at the population level. With a focus on low and middle income countries various nutrition assessment methodologies are then applied to designing large, population-based interventions as a tool for early warning, needs assessment, program planning and program evaluation. Students will have the opportunity to apply the principles and frameworks for program planning and management in response to existing and emerging specific nutrition problems in low and middle income contexts. The design, development, implementation and evaluation of evidence-based community-level nutrition programs is also addressed.","Today's globalised world is marked by record levels of displacement and migration. Migrant communities face a range of health problems dependent on the type of migration and the demographic profile of the migrant population. This unit examines public health topics in specific migrant populations including refugees, the internally displaced, asylum seekers and immigrants. Using a social determinants of health framework students explore the ways that health within migrant populations is influenced by social, political, economic, and cultural factors. The affect of migration on public health and public health systems is investigated. Strategies to address health issues in migrant populations are critiqued. The role of nutrition and active living in the health of migrant populations is analysed in particular.","1.

MST,Victoria University,City Flinders,Master of Supply Chain Management,Victoria University Business School,"15,300",,AUD,Year,1.5,Years,IELTS,,,6.5,,,https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/international/BMSP,English,A,"Get a hands-on, world-class education in supply chain management. Benefit from industry experience and our top research centre to become a logistics professional. Our Master of Supply Chain Management offers exceptional opportunities to gain industry knowledge and skills. Many of our lecturers are practising professionals, with current, relevant experience. You’ll also have access to a world-class research program. You’ll study all the fundamentals of supply chain management. You’ll graduate with a well-honed skill set to support the supply chain, including:",supply chain manager/ logistics professional/ global procurement specialist/ sourcing/distribution manager/ enterprise resource planning developer/ project leader/ transport coordinator/ warehouse supervisor/ import/export manager/ customs manager.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Enterprise Resource Planning Systems,Business Analytics and Visualisation,International Supply Chain Structure,Global Procurement,Business Ethics and Sustainability,Supply Chain and Logistics Management,Green Logistics,Operations Management,Business Research Methods,Business Research Project,"This unit provides students with a foundation in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and identifies the key issues for organisations involved in acquiring and maintaining large-scale software systems. The strategic significance of ERP systems in organisations is demonstrated through investigating how ERP systems support business processes, and examining the relationship between the configuration of enterprise systems modules and the design of organisational structures and practices. The objective of the unit is to provide students with sufficient knowledge of ERP systems so that they can appreciate the role and functionality of ERP software as well as being able to contribute effectively in projects for acquiring and enhancing ERP software.","Business analytics and visualisation focuses on uncovering business insights hidden in massive datasets using statistical models and algorithms. Visualisation is the vital component of analysing data and communicating insights to stakeholders. The unit equips students with foundational knowledge in business analytics and visualisation to be able to analyse business data, convert insights into business decisions and communicate results to stakeholders. Using open source software (R and Python), students are exposed to a range of business analytics approaches and algorithms, including tidy data presentation, various data wrangling approaches, data storytelling and visualisation basics. Using project workflow and working with real world data, students learn how to work with different datatypes, build and evaluate models, develop data visualisation and communicate insights to stakeholders.","This unit explores the problems, concepts and practices of global logistics in international trading ecosystems, including its role in achieving a competitive edge for firms in international business and an understanding of logistics perspectives in different countries and industries. It will encompass topics such as supply chain strategy; the impact of trade pacts in defining global logistics; customer services; global logistics and physical distribution; role of third party logistics in international business; international distribution practices across companies; logistics performance index (LPI) measures; logistic support for international market entry; export processes; influence of global logistics on corporate profit; and planning, control and audit of global logistics in international decision environment.","This unit of study aims to enhance student’s understanding of the operational importance of procurement, across geographical boundaries, for the strategic acquisition of goods and services by business organisations.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","Supply chain management (SCM) is an information-directed flow of products and services from suppliers to end consumers, managed by a number of partner firms, so that the merchandise is produced and distributed at optimum costs while satisfying service level requirement. The unit provides students with an understanding of flow of products, information, funds and knowledge that underpin demand and supply matching through sales and operations planning in a supply chain. In particular, the unit equips students with various theories, models and strategies to take rational business decision in product as well as services supply chain. The core focus is on supply chain integration (SCI) mechanism where the students understand the role of information and communication technologies in support of multi-parties collaboration that enable visibility and real time flow of goods and services, improves operational efficiency and enhances sustainable firm performance. 

Further, students will be introduced with the appropriate use of emerging technologies like cloud, IoT, blockchain and AI/ML for improving operational efficiency for firms of all sizes. The unit familiarises students with supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model that comprises of plan, source, make, deliver, return and enable as the basic management processes for improved, faster, and more granular support of decision making while transitioning to Supply Chan 4.0. Realising the potential of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, the unit provides students with sufficient knowledge of Advanced Planning and Optimisation (APO) software where they complete a hands on computer-based individual project so that they can appreciate the role and functionalities of APO to source, make, and deliver products in a supply chain network. Also, the unit includes a visit to a warehouse where the students are exposed to live operations within the facility.","Green logistics and supply chain management enables a firm to attain its economic targets, minimise environmental hazards, reduce its harmful environmental effects, and enhance the ecological efficiency of the firm and its partners across the supply chain. The unit provides students a comprehensive view of the subject that illustrates the environmental impacts of logistics and the actions that companies can take to deal with them. The unit exposes students to various ways in which freight transport adversely affects the environment, how the impact can be measured and environmental standards can be imposed. In particular, the focus will be on key topics like carbon auditing of supply chains; transferring freight to greener transport modes; reducing the environmental impact of warehousing; improving the energy efficiency of freight transport; making city logistics more environmentally sustainable; and role of government in promoting sustainable logistics. 

The unit takes a strategic perspective of the logistics where students will appreciate the role of environmental metrics in design of freight transport network, location of nodes, choice of transport mode and creation of carbon-neutral warehousing. With the popularity of smart city, the unit covers the establishment of urban consolidation centres and environmental zone that can improve the sustainability of last mile delivery into cities. The unit updates students with the recent development on green logistics such as distribution by drone, 3D printing, physical Internet and concept of ""peak freight"" that have the potential to reduce the impact of logistics on environment.","Operations management (OM) is a set of activities that creates value in the form of goods and services by transferring inputs into outputs. The efficient production of these goods and services requires effective applications of concepts, tools and techniques of OM where students will appreciate their importance in improving organisations' productivity. In particular, the focus will be on inventory planning and control, total quality management, scheduling and just in time operations where sales and operations planning justifies their key roles in demand and supply matching. The unit equips students with an understanding of OM at the centre of a supply chain, design of products and processes, strategic approach to cost, quality, delivery and flexibility dimensions, and integrated material requirement planning that make an organisation competitive over others. As the manufacturing is progressively shifting to strategically low cost country locations, the students appreciate the outsourcing strategy, make or buy decision as key to anywhere production, anywhere consumption paradigm. This concept introduces students with Industry 4.0 vision of cyber-physical systems where the autonomous manufacturing is here to lead the way in a global supply chain.","The purpose of the unit is to provide students with a firm foundation and understanding of business research methods and the research process. Instruction will be provided which will enable students to perform effective literature reviews. Students will be instructed in various research methodologies, the importance of ethical research conduct, and considerations of sampling and fieldwork to assist them with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions drawn.","The project provides students with the opportunity, either individually or in teams to apply an advanced body of knowledge and skills to an approved, consultancy-based task. Proposals for projects will normally be developed in conjunction with the unit of study Business Research Methods (BMO6630). Each project should lead to business innovations or potential entrepreneurship development. Research may include analysis and anticipation of user or business needs; business scenario development and business case studies; the study of existing business practices and solutions, and innovative business models development.","1.

This course incorporates tourism and management studies with a focus on addressing contemporary issues and challenges faced by destinations internationally. The program is embedded within an established suite of business programs including Victoria University’s internationally awarded MBA.","planning and policy development officers in government departments at national, state and local and regional levels/ research and planning officers with research and consulting firms/ tourism planning and promotion agency staff/ tourism educators through private providers and TAFE/ policy officers with professional and industry associations/ managers of attractions/ marketing and communication roles (events)/ planners within the travel sector (airlines and other major transport providers)/ self employment through tourism management businesses.",Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Tourism and Events: Core Concepts and Theory,Cross-cultural Dimensions of Destination Management,Art and Practice of Leadership,Business Research Methods,Business Ethics and Sustainability,International Tourism Management,Emerging Trends in Tourism and Destination Management,Business Research  Proposal,Predictive Analytics,Green Growth Transformation of Destinations,"Contemporary tourism is one of the most significant phenomenon in the world today. It is something that is engaged in by many people in the developed world and increasingly in developing countries, and is regarded as an important mechanism for economic development. The aim of the unit is to examine the role of tourism, hospitality and events as a catalyst for destination development and promotion. The unit aims to provide students with a broader understanding of the environment in which events are staged and the integral roles that hospitality and tourism play in the event industry. The unit highlights selected tourism, hospitality and events issues and challenges and give students insights into career choices and activities. It focuses on the evolution of tourism, hospitality and events and their scope and importance, both for the Australian economy and internationally. Students will be equipped with cognitive, technical and creative skills and knowledge to address real-world situations and recommend appropriate actions, strategies and policies.","This unit considers theoretical and practical applications of cross-cultural issues and activities including but not confined to: the universals of social behaviour, culture and ethics, communication, cross-cultural interaction and the outcomes of cross-cultural contact. It has particular application to destination management and tourism and is designed to give students an understanding of globalisation and national cultures and to develop skills to manage and communicate effectively within an increasingly globalised environment. The unit prepares students for understanding cross-cultural dimensions and issues and contributes to their capability as an informed and professional 21st century professional. 
The unit is structured in a seminar/workshop style to enable students to understand more fully the need to be culturally aware and culturally sensitive in all aspects of destination management and tourism.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","The purpose of the unit is to provide students with a firm foundation and understanding of business research methods and the research process. Instruction will be provided which will enable students to perform effective literature reviews. Students will be instructed in various research methodologies, the importance of ethical research conduct, and considerations of sampling and fieldwork to assist them with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions drawn.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","In a world that is experiencing constant economic, social, technical and environmental changes, the business of sourcing, transporting, hosting and satisfying tourists from established and emerging markets is both complex and important. Tourism managers must adjust to all sorts of changes to assure a sustained inflow of resources and a continuing outward flow of services and be alert to an increasing diversity of impacts that result from the strategy, policy and management design they select. This unit provides students with a broad understanding of tourism and the tourism system in an international context. It also provides a framework for evaluating the management of tourism in relation to consumers, businesses and destinations in a variety of international settings By becoming familiar with the concepts and techniques, students will have powerful tools to analyse new business and tourism developments and to interpret threats and opportunities for tourism companies.","Emerging Trends in Tourism and Destination Management explores the contemporary issues that face both tourism and destination management organisations as they navigate the 21st century. Principal among these challenges is the changing demographic and ethnicity of today's traveller brought about through greater democratisation of travel, trade and visa deregulation and globalisation. Students will be encouraged to discuss the role of terrorism on travel patterns, digital disruption in the sector, the rise in CSR and sustainability measures and the specialisation and fragmentation of the tourism, hospitality and event spaces and how that affects visitation strategy.","The Business Research Proposal provides students with an opportunity to apply and modify investigative, analytical and critical skills gained and developed through the coursework units to the resolution of a business problem. Established theories to different bodies of knowledge or practice will be critiqued in the context of a scoped investigation contextualised to a specified community/organisation in an ethical and socially responsible manner.  The research proposal provides the preliminary stages of the research for the completion of the minor thesis. Students will also complete an Ethics Application form to be assessed by the University's Ethics Committee. The thesis topic must be approved by the course co-ordinator.","The unit is concentrated on big data oriented learning and practices. In order for organisations to gain a competitive advantage, industry practitioners are required to be able to predict anomalies, disorders or indicators from their business categorical and numerical data that could lead to capture appropriate insights for their effective decision making. 
Emerging technologies to various successful analytics systems implementation are continuously evolving to make effective predictions for quick decision support. This unit provides students with the knowledge and skills to utilise predictive analytics and data mining processes and technologies to gain greater insights into various business scenarios. Students will gain an overview of foundational knowledge on various applications of predictive analytics tools and techniques for enabling action-able decision solutions supported by industry case studies and hands-on exercises. Students will learn how data mining and predictive analytics can facilitate business intelligence and build analytical capabilities in organisations in the 21st century.","Destination Green Growth aims to introduce students to the theory and practice of how tourism destinations can make the transformation into a green growth pathway. In the context of the emerging global green growth paradigm, tourism destinations are faced with opportunities and challenges to transform into a more socially inclusive, low-carbon, resource-efficient, stable economy. Through the lenses of concept, policy and practice, this unit provides students with a systematic perspective on wide-ranging and complex implications of the green growth paradigm for tourism destinations, including the entire travel and tourism value chain as well as communities in destinations.","1.
