We will explore different sites in Footscray in order to engage with conceptions of value including, for example, beauty, order, justice, and community. Students will plan field trips, organise their findings, link their experiences to academic texts, and present the findings of their explorations to their peers. Collectively, we will learn about conceptions of value that relate to the Humanities, Social Sciences and Creative Arts, and engage with evidence of the pursuit of these values by organizations operating in our local community.","Focusing on the intellectual, political and historical forces that have shaped the modern world, this unit develops the knowledge and skills required to participate in debates concerning the formation of contemporary culture and society. It introduces students to the core concepts of tradition and modernity, familiarises them with a range of positions and discourses in contemporary academic debates and examines the historical sources of these concepts and debates, with particular emphasis on the intellectual and social revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In focusing on key historical debates, and the positions that underpin them, the unit aims to provide students with an understanding of the critical discourses needed to analyse and interpret the systems that shape the contemporary world.","This unit introduces students to the world of academic research and familiarises them with a selection of methods employed across the Creative Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. In focussing on the theme of biography, the unit examines how different academic disciplines approach research and identifies the differences between obtrusive and unobtrusive methods. In developing a research proposal, students will identify a suitable research topic, formulate a key question, and design a suitable method for undertaking research.  In doing so, they are planning for the theoretical, logistical and ethical challenges confronting real world research.","This introductory unit seeks to give an overview of sociology - an introduction to how we might go about 'thinking society' in a systematic and disciplined way. This unit examines processes of social change and offers the opportunity to critically examine social issues and explore questions of social and cultural identity. It looks at how that theory might be applied to specific areas of investigation and research. The unit aims to equip students with the ability to distinguish a sociological approach from other possible approaches to information, social situations, issues and problems; to recognise and experiment with different theoretical frameworks within sociology; and to begin to apply a range of critical analytical skills to a variety of contemporary social arrangements and social issues.","This unit encourages students to critically engage with and analyse a variety of historical and contemporary literary, visual and performance texts. By examining the ways that storytelling and argument generate the meaning in human communications, students will learn to respond to texts in imaginative and critical ways. In developing methodologies for reading and interpreting texts, the unit will especially cultivate students' fluency in analysing the interplay between form and content in those texts. Students will also be introduced to several current theoretical perspectives.","This unit focuses on tensions and conflicts arising from modernity and the historical and contemporary processes of modernisation. By drawing on disciplines across the Humanities and Social Sciences this investigation develops students' understandings of the origins of the world in which they live, introducing them to a range of historical and social theoretical perspectives. Students will establish critical skills that enable them to analyse and interpret historical ideas and events and to engage with global political and economic issues that frame contemporary life.","Creativity, Communication and the Digital Age introduces students to the dynamic relationship between media and communications technologies and creative and cultural practice. Through a critical and historical analysis of the epochal technological and social changes that led to the emergence of the digital age, it affords students the opportunity to consider how old and new media relate and intersect in the framing of the worlds in which we live. By blending theory and practice, this unit explores how media technology shapes and is shaped by culture, and thereby demonstrates how students and graduates are increasingly digitally literate producers and curators of knowledge and ideas rather than simply consumers or conveyors of the creative output of others.","This unit of study will be an introduction to the history of the Aboriginal struggle and the continual impact of colonisation upon Aboriginal Australian peoples. Students will explore the role of Aboriginal activism, including why Indigenous peoples have and continue to resist. Students will take part in a wide variety of activities in which they will be expected to engage in critical reflection and reading, and discussions.","This unit offers students an opportunity to experience academic life, particularly as it relates to the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Creative Arts, through an exploration of social value in and around Footscray.

Microeconomic topics include an analysis of the competitive environment facing firms, including: pricing, market structure, market failure and transaction costs. Macroeconomic topics include a review of significant national and international economic challenges, including: business cycles, inflation, unemployment and international competitiveness. These will be examined from the perspective of government stabilisation policies and strategies to enhance productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area. This unit of study will explore the principal elements in external and internal environments which impact on organisations and consider how current theoretical frameworks and the interdisciplinary and professional knowledge base respond to complex issues. High level analytical and planning skills will be required to prepare relevant business plans.","The unit applies theoretical and conceptual knowledge to develop creative problem solving of everyday human resource management (HRM) related issues and challenges in the workplace.

Topics covered include: types of companies; corporate personality; company constitutions; contracts made by the company; share capital and loan capital; the duties of directors and managers; and shareholder remedies.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","Strategic Management examines the decisions, actions and processes undertaken by firms for success, growth and change in a business environment. Managers at all levels are involved in the strategic management process and must be able to utilize an advanced body of knowledge and skills to plan and problem solve in this area.

Using open source software (R and Python), students are exposed to a range of business analytics approaches and algorithms, including tidy data presentation, various data wrangling approaches, data storytelling and visualisation basics. Using project workflow and working with real world data, students learn how to work with different datatypes, build and evaluate models, develop data visualisation and communicate insights to stakeholders.","This unit critically reviews the socio-cultural environment in which business operates. Ethical frameworks for decision making will be critiqued and students will construct the debates surrounding contemporary corporate responsibility and sustainable development as they impact on organisations in their local and global contexts. Emphasis will be on how new pressures on businesses arise, and how effective the various models that structure organisational responses are to these dynamic and emergent challenges.","Green logistics and supply chain management enables a firm to attain its economic targets, minimise environmental hazards, reduce its harmful environmental effects, and enhance the ecological efficiency of the firm and its partners across the supply chain. The unit provides students a comprehensive view of the subject that illustrates the environmental impacts of logistics and the actions that companies can take to deal with them. The unit exposes students to various ways in which freight transport adversely affects the environment, how the impact can be measured and environmental standards can be imposed. In particular, the focus will be on key topics like carbon auditing of supply chains; transferring freight to greener transport modes; reducing the environmental impact of warehousing; improving the energy efficiency of freight transport; making city logistics more environmentally sustainable; and role of government in promoting sustainable logistics. 

The unit takes a strategic perspective of the logistics where students will appreciate the role of environmental metrics in design of freight transport network, location of nodes, choice of transport mode and creation of carbon-neutral warehousing. With the popularity of smart city, the unit covers the establishment of urban consolidation centres and environmental zone that can improve the sustainability of last mile delivery into cities. The unit updates students with the recent development on green logistics such as distribution by drone, 3D printing, physical Internet and concept of ""peak freight"" that have the potential to reduce the impact of logistics on environment.","1.

The practical experiences of student youth or community workers in partnerships are also the basis of their critical reflection and theorising on practice, which leads to sustainable improvement and change.

Professional Practice is an opportunity for students to participate in a range of specific program or projects that youth or community services offer such as Youth and Community events, sports programs, sports programs and community recreation programs, Community Advocacy networks, Community Centres, National Youth Week, School Holiday Programs, Camps, Youth and Community Conferences or summits and much more. Each student has the opportunity to do one of their placements overseas whilst the other must be in a domestic setting. Undertaking a variety of experiences in line with emerging interests allows a student to reflect on the breadth of the industry and the diverse opportunities available to them as a Youth or Community Worker. Students will need to document their experiences by creating a reflective journal. 

As each placement is unique, students are required to negotiate their tasks, responsibilities and timelines with their agency supervisor and undertake regular supervision to reflect on their practice.","1.

You'll gain a strong understanding of the factors that contribute to criminal behaviour. You'll also learn about the legal, political and community responses to social dislocation and disorder. Our expert lecturers deliver a clear overview of:","justice sector (for example, victim support officer, investigator)/ health and community services (for example, child protection worker)/ policy development and related services.",Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Young People in a Global Community,Psychology 1A,Psychology 1B,Foundations of Psychological Research,Applied Human Rights,Criminal Justice Systems,Working in Human Services Organisations,Foundations of Social Science Research,Psychology 2A,Psychology 2B,"This unit identifies young people as global citizens and considers their transitions to adulthood in the context of culture, socio economic status, family, education and employment. The unit will explore and apply theories in sociology to consider the impact of globalisation, global structures and current trends on young people in the global community. It is particularly important for practitioners across the youth work, community development, and criminal justice sectors, who will be working with young people in the context of globalisation and growing interdependence.","The aim of this unit of study is to provide students with an introduction to several key discipline areas in the field of psychology, thus establishing a solid basis for further, more in-depth study in subsequent years. This unit covers topics including the research enterprise in psychology; neuropsychology; memory; language and cognition; learning; motivation and emotion; interpersonal relationships; and personality. Classes involve activities and discussion of research papers that foster understanding of theoretical content by focusing on specific topics and applications of research and knowledge in psychology.","The aim of this unit of study is to build upon Psychology 1A by introducing students to further key discipline areas within the field of psychology, as well as topics in applied psychology. This unit covers topics including health and stress; sleep; sensation and perception; social psychology; risk taking behaviours; psychological disorders and treatment; intelligence; and history of psychology. Classes involve activities and discussion of research papers that foster understanding of theoretical content by focussing on specific topics and applications of research and knowledge in psychology.","This unit uses the examination of key historical and at times controversial psychology research studies to help develop students' academic skills and foundational research knowledge. Students will be provided with opportunities to develop their skills in searching for research papers, reviewing the methods employed in research studies, and discussing the implications and applications of psychological research. The review of key studies in psychology will also foster students' understanding of how psychological research has evolved and the contributions psychological research and practice has made to our understanding of human behaviour and mental processes.","This unit introduces students to human rights frameworks, theories, and practices, and the ways these operate in diverse social and cultural contexts. The unit outlines the history and development of human rights, including  international and national frameworks. Students will explore human rights practice through case study examples of a range of human rights issues, violations, and responses.","This unit is offered in the First Year Model where you will study the unit intensively over a four-week block.  In this unit we will explore the concepts of crime and criminality. This is because how we as a society understand these concepts, shapes how we construct and use our criminal justice systems in order to respond to crime. We will see that there are many different ways in which ideas about crime and criminality are produced and shared amongst members of society, including those representations of crime produced by, for example, stories circulated by the media, case law produced through the courts, statistics produced by government bodies, speeches made by politicians, and expert analysis produced by academics. By doing this, we shall see that the concepts of crime and criminality are complex. As we shall also see, these complex ideas about what crime is are linked to the systems through which crime is addressed. Through our studies in this unit we shall begin to appreciate the complexity of the Australian criminal justice systems.","This unit of study introduces students to key dimensions of human service organisations. A range of theoretical models from different disciplinary perspectives are presented and critically examined from the viewpoints of key stakeholders including workers, service users, managers, funding bodies and policy makers. A focus on the organisational context of professional practice in the human services contributes to students' preparation for their future practice.","This unit introduces students to the concepts, processes and practices of social science research. Theoretical content will build understanding of key concepts and terms in social research, and practical engagement in workshops supports the development of skills and understanding in social research processes and practices. Workshop activities in academic reading, writing and research skills will prepare students for assessments in this and other units, and assessment tasks have been designed to progressively develop and test growing skills, knowledge and comprehension.","This unit of study is designed to provide students with an understanding of theories and methods in, cognitive and biological psychology and further training in research methods. The cognitive psychology component aims to extend students' knowledge of learning and cognition, perception and brain-behaviour relationships. The basic principles and methods of psychological assessment will also be examined. The research methods component provides students with training in quantitative research methods including theory and application. Students will develop an understanding of techniques of data collection, data entry, data analysis, statistical programs and report writing.","This unit of study focuses on personality and social psychology, and includes further training in research methods to build upon the knowledge and skills developed in APP2013 Psychology 2A. The aim of the personality and social psychology content is to present these topics in such a way as to illustrate their relevance to situations encountered in everyday life. Students will become familiar with some of the central conceptual frameworks and models developed by social psychologists to account for individual behaviour in social settings, and to explain how social phenomena are cognitively represented by the individual. The unit also focuses on contemporary personality theory and research, and introduces issues of personality assessment and measurement. Students are also introduced to more advanced statistical techniques than those covered in Psychology 2A, and these are presented in the context of research methods typically employed in personality and social psychology.","1.

Students will explore human rights practice through case study examples of a range of human rights issues, violations, and responses.","This unit is offered in the First Year Model where you will study the unit intensively over a four-week block.  In this unit we will explore the concepts of crime and criminality. This is because how we as a society understand these concepts, shapes how we construct and use our criminal justice systems in order to respond to crime. We will see that there are many different ways in which ideas about crime and criminality are produced and shared amongst members of society, including those representations of crime produced by, for example, stories circulated by the media, case law produced through the courts, statistics produced by government bodies, speeches made by politicians, and expert analysis produced by academics. By doing this, we shall see that the concepts of crime and criminality are complex. As we shall also see, these complex ideas about what crime is are linked to the systems through which crime is addressed. Through our studies in this unit we shall begin to appreciate the complexity of the Australian criminal justice systems.","This unit of study introduces students to key dimensions of human service organisations. A range of theoretical models from different disciplinary perspectives are presented and critically examined from the viewpoints of key stakeholders including workers, service users, managers, funding bodies and policy makers. A focus on the organisational context of professional practice in the human services contributes to students' preparation for their future practice.","Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary scenarios relevant to the community, youth and justice sectors. Utilising a project-based approach students will complete a professional style report on a chosen scenario. This unit will begin the process of developing key academic and professional skills. Students will select a scenario, describe the background and context, identify and analyse the key issues, and propose appropriate responses. The knowledge and skills developed in this unit will prepare students for work in a range of youth and community contexts and work environments.","This foundation unit introduces students to the 'nuts and bolts' of the Australian Legal system and legal reasoning. In addition, it offers a selection of socio-political contexts within which to situate and critically evaluate the contemporary Australian legal system.  This unit provides a foundation for the study of law at Victoria University and, as such, successful completion is a pre-requisite for progression through the Law course.

This unit:

Provides students with a working foundation in the technical structure of Australian legal systems and legal reasoning, using applied practical teaching and learning methods;



Exposes students to ways of making sense of Australian legal systems and legal process in a legal academic way, using selected contexts from criminal and private law;

Introduces students to the broader contexts in which legal issues may arise, including the political, social, historical, philosophical and economic contexts; and

Inducts students in the ways of the lawyer, including and legal reasoning and appropriate language use and structure

using reflective, applied and theory-based teaching and learning methods.","This unit introduces students to the history, sociology, and politics of policing and corrections. The unit examines the administration of justice from the reporting and detection of crime through to the correctional regimes of offenders. It highlights important debates around issues of accountability, and traces the historical shape of policing and corrections that have led to the features and characteristics of contemporary institutions and practices. In addition to exploring the domain of policy, we focus on a number of key challenges and issues that confront police and corrections officers in their day to day working lives. The unit is underpinned by an interest in questions around balancing the power of the state, identifying the rights and protections afforded citizens through the 'rule of law' and democratic safeguards, and exploring the powers that are exercised in the processes of investigating crime and sanctioning individuals.","This unit of study explores how and why public life in contemporary Australia is gendered. Contextualised within global trends and debates, students will be encouraged to consider the consequences for all people: across genders, race, class and culture. Drawing upon theories on the construction of the state and of citizenship, along with gender analyses of law, work, education and politics, the focus will be upon the roles of public institutions and the making of policy change. Practically the unit develops social, qualitative research and writing skills.","This unit introduces students to the theoretical and practical frameworks used to effectively understand the role of practitioners working with young people in supporting and referring young people with social, health and wellbeing issues. The unit aims to ensure good practice in relation to youth workers acting as referral points and working collaboratively with specialist practitioners. Youth workers work from a strengths-based framework of practice and as such, students consider various strategies to use while working with young people who present with various forms of wellbeing issues including, bullying, challenging behaviours and other causal circumstances such as homelessness. This is primarily a practice unit to enable students to understand the parameters of their professional ethical practice, identify strengths-based practice, and learn how to utilise complementary practitioners to ensure the holistic health and wellbeing of young people.","1.

Research is a fundamental skill which enables you to improve your knowledge, understanding and action in daily life. In an academic and legal setting, it enables you to locate contemporary law and academic knowledge, then critically evaluate the content and credibility of sources. The unit introduces the concept and process of research, encouraging students to develop their critical reading and analytical skills. It introduces the academic integrity principles and citation systems that scholarly writing must employ. Like any discipline, law uses its own language and media forms and this unit is designed to enable students to master these. Legal scholars must be familiar with primary sources of law and the specific ways in which academic and legal authorities must be recorded in legal writing. The unit introduces students to the broad variety of secondary and primary legal sources and the manner in which they may be both located and cited. Legal scholarship involves an understanding of the relationship between primary legal sources and the dynamic between primary and secondary legal sources. This unit provides students with the legal knowledge and analytical skills necessary to master scholarly legal analysis. By focusing on the technical and conceptual skills underlying legal research, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throught their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","The unit introduces students to an array of explanations for crime that form the basis of criminological theory, placing these in their historical and political context. The unit explores: the changing nature of what we understand as crime; traditional and mainstream explanations for why people commit crime; the emergence of academic challenges to mainstream explanations of criminality; victims and victimology; inequality and social difference; and crime and the media. In addition, the unit explores the way in which information and statistics on crime are collected. Students will be encouraged to understand the connection between criminological approaches and practical responses to crime.","This unit introduces students to the history, sociology, and politics of policing and corrections. The unit examines the administration of justice from the reporting and detection of crime through to the correctional regimes of offenders.

It introduces students to the effects of disadvantage on criminal behaviour and policing and legal responses to disorder.  The unit reviews the roles that gender, race, ethnicity and class play in the criminal justice system and explores the reasons why some groups are over-represented in offending and incarceration rates.Students will work through contemporary issues such as gender-based violence, indigenous incarceration, policing and bias and the unequal application of the criminal law for crimes related to disadvantage.","This unit together with Criminal Investigation Procedure and Sentencing satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal Law is a core law subject for the LLB degree. It covers substantive criminal law. Substantive criminal law refers to the law that creates criminal offences. Offences can generally be categorised into offences against the person (homicide offences, assault, sexual offences), property offences (burglary, theft, obtaining financial advantage or property by deception), inchoate offences (conspiracy, incitement or attempt in relation to an existing offence) and complicity (the extent to which a person can be held liable for the actions of another person). Of course, an understanding of criminal liability also requires an understanding of defences.","This unit together with Criminal Law satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal procedure refers to the law and practices of investigating and enforcing criminal law. Sentencing covers the sanctions imposed on offenders in enforcement. It covers: courts exercising criminal jurisdiction; classification of offences; search, seizure and forensic processes; police questioning; arrest; commencing criminal proceedings; bail; committal hearings; pleadings and plea negotiations; and, the criminal trial including the functions of judges and juries, prosecutors and defence lawyers. It also covers the legal framework for sentencing including: the sources of law; the principles of parsimony, proportionality, parity and totality; sentencing hearings; public and victim input; and, control of sentencing discretions. They are considered in the context of philosophical concepts and public policies balancing the community's interest in the prevention of crime and protecting the liberties of the individual and in competing concepts of justice and the role of the legislative, executive, judicial branches of government.","Familiarity with key concepts and theories of law, and the ability to interpret legislation, are essential skills in understanding law and legal systems. This unit of study will examine the philosophy of law in historical and contemporary context. Natural law and legal positivist theories are explored with reference to other disciplines (such as history, philosophy, theology, sociology and political science). The unit introduces further approaches to legal theory including legal realism, sociological legal theories, historical and anthropological theories, and critical legal theories. Foundational legal concepts of rights, duties, justice and punishment are considered in theoretical and normative terms. This course will provide an advanced study of the rules and principles governing statutory interpretation and will consider how statutes have been read and are being read by the Australian courts.  The concepts, interpretative criteria, and the techniques of the common law are examined with reference to federal and state legislation. This unit will enable students to interpret statutes and to engage critically with the main arguments that characterise modern interpretive practice. By focusing on the theoretical issues underlying law and legal systems, and the theoretical and technical basis of statutory interpretation, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throughout their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","Corporate crime is a significant economic drain on society. In this unit we shall examine the main forms of corporate crime ranging from company and security offences, collusion and corruption, taxation, consumer affairs and safety, and the environment.  Case studies will be used to consider the determination of offences and the circumstances that lead to corporate crime.    The unit will then consider the criminal liability of corporations, as well as their directors. The unit will then apply consider international examples of misconduct including misconduct in the context of corporate negligence as well as financial and accounting fraud.  Policies, governance regulations, ethical guidelines and laws aimed at detecting and preventing corporate crime will be evaluated.  The unit will conclude by considering the treatment of white collar offending in sentencing and comparing white collar criminal responsibility, to the civil penalty scheme, and the rationale and overlap between the two schemes.","This unit examines the history and development of the criminal law and the adversarial criminal trial including the role of the jury. It considers their evolution from earlier forms of trial and the impact of permitting accused to be represented by barristers, the formalising of rules of evidence and the historical roots of a raft of procedural safeguards. The Unit deals with pre-trial investigations, the historic role of justices of the peace and the emergence of organised policing. It examines the changing role of technology both in investigation and contemporary trial practice considering the early emergence of fingerprinting and forensic analysis. Current calls for criminal justice reform of procedural or legal practice, along with analysis of miscarriages of justice will be considered through the lens of their historical emergence and claims for ongoing legitimacy.","1.

It encompasses knowledge regarding the musculoskeletal and nervous systems in a context relevant to face and body treatments, and introduces students to the functions, structure and thermoregulatory role of the integumentary system. The skin and its appendages are reviewed with regards to structure and function.","This unit provides students with the knowledge and skills required for effective communication with clients, colleagues and industry representatives in a professional clinical environment. As part of the learning experience consideration is given to legal, ethical and privacy requirements alongside the concepts of social and cultural diversity in the workplace.  Students will be guided in how to confidently perform an effective consultation, as optimal communication between the dermal therapist and the client is required to ensure the safety and efficacy of dermal therapies procedures.","A robust understanding of the principles of human anatomy and physiology is fundamental to the knowledge base of health professionals. This foundational and interdisciplinary unit for students provides an introduction to the structure and function of the human body and the underpinning knowledge for subsequent units in anatomy and physiology and other health related courses. Following a brief overview of the organisation of the human body, students are introduced to anatomical terms, the chemical and structural basis of cell function, and body tissues including the integumentary system. Students are introduced to microbiology within the context of infection prevention and control. Specific topics to be addressed will include the physiological control of major organ systems including the nervous, circulatory, cardiovascular, respiratory and reproductive systems. Upon completion of the unit, students will be able to explain the integration of normal structure and function and the role of homeostatic feedback control systems in maintaining bodily functions. The aim of this unit is to provide a firm basis for further studies of physiological functioning in health and disease.","This unit expands on content from 'Anatomy and Physiology 1' of the structure and function of the human body, using homeostatic regulation of the internal environment as the ongoing theme. The endocrine and renal systems are discussed, as well as their roles in the regulation of variables such as fluid and electrolyte balance and acid-base balance. Specific topics include the major physiological systems of the human body, including the renal, endocrine, special senses, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, genetic inheritance, lymphatic and immune systems in the human body. The completion of both HBM1001 and HBM1202 Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2 units will provide a solid foundation for advanced study in physiology.","This unit will assist students to develop skills in describing the origins and concepts of public health and its relationship to contemporary public health initiatives, challenges and practices. Students will gain knowledge on health and its determinants and how these impact on public health interventions. The role of public health at each stage of the disease continuum will be used to introduce definitions and interventions that address identified health priorities.","Students will be introduced to foods and food groups, the nutrients they provide, and the Australian dietary recommendations for adult human health. This will include gaining an understanding of the sources, role and function of the macronutrients (protein, fat and carbohydrate), key micronutrients, fibre and fluid, as well as the digestion, absorption and metabolism of the macronutrients. Students will be introduced to the concepts of energy balance and the role of diet in maintaining this balance.","This unit aims to demystify research and to build in students the confidence needed to use evidence with purpose. The unit will help students to understand what research is, to find relevant research products, and to consume and evaluate those products. Students will build foundational knowledge regarding discipline-based and professional contexts (as they relate to distinct course cohorts) in which research is produced and used (e.g. the evidence based practice paradigm as it applies to the health professions). Students will also build skills related to the sourcing, summary, and citing of literature. Students will be supported as they start to apply their knowledge and skills in order to communicate evidence to their peers. In doing so, the unit will enhance students' capacity and confidence to successfully use evidence in their academic and professional work.",This unit begins to establish the professional identity of a dermal therapist by enabling the student to substantiate their role in the aesthetics industry as a sole entity as well as being a member of an inter-professional team. It does so by providing an introduction to critical thinking and the philosophy of science required to be able to undertake studies in the dermal and health sciences.

The ontological and epistemological foundations to various approaches to social research will be critically reviewed. Students will become broadly familiar with the concepts of logic and methodology and quantitative and qualitative research methods. They will be able to select a research topic(s), design research proposal(s) and adopt appropriate research methods. To emphasis skills development in research training, students will practice with (and use) commonly used social research software tools.","Visual image development is different to the processes traditionally adopted by designers. This unit introduces students to new processes and approaches to the design of digital screens, including mobile devices. Grounded in the context of the research area of user experience (UX), students develop practical skills to create images and 'clickable wireframes'. The unit explores the role of branding in a globalised world where designers need to respond to a variety of communication styles to connect with different audiences. Using a range of case studies, students explore how industry communicates with different demographic groups and critique assumptions made about different groups. The unit covers the latest developments and assesses the viability of trends. Other topics explored include processes to create a design concept, relationship between text and image, handling different file types and employment contexts for designers.","In this unit, students examine some of the technological developments that have made computer mediated forms of artistic expression and communication possible. Students explore some of the conventions of visual and aural language, techniques for creating digital sound, video ad other forms of moving image. They undertake production and post-production of digital audio and video. Students also storyboard, shoot, digitise and edit video clips and create digital sound effects and sound tracks. Readings cover the history of video and sound technologies, technical theory and technique. The aesthetics of combining audio and video are considered through introductory discussion of film theory.","Web technology is at the core of today's entrepreneurial and innovative culture and in this unit we explore how individuals can negotiate current industry contexts, including lean and scrum environments. We explore how to understand and apply knowledge about trends in digital cultures. Focusing initially on the notion of the 'minimal viable product', we generate, manage  and prototype ideas for web technologies in different social settings. The unit will familiarise students with the means and tools to develop digital environments in an era when those with some training, for instance in Javascript and CSS, can co-opt different technologies for their own purposes. We also review topical issues such as content strategy and search engine optimization and keyword research. Students develop their own portfolio website.","Interconnected digital environments create a growing pool of data in the form of web analytics and social network information. In this unit we explore how to harness this data to inform decisions and the methodologies used in industry. This unit reviews use made of such data using case studies from a range of fields. Learning analytics are a form of web analytics gaining importance for students and academics. We review the implications and the 'actionable insights' from this type of data. 

Students will learn about analytical tools available to professionals, in particular, those that measure the performance of digital environments or products. They will learn how such tools inform research into the behaviour of users, product or service developments and improvements in campaign or project outcomes. For instance, we explore how to analyse 'hashtags' in order to inform design and marketing practice. 

The unit is grounded in the consideration of the complexities in the field including those of trust, privacy, and information injustice.","Digital media is expanding into many areas of everyday life. The use of digital media to support sport and health is a burgeoning area.  Digital media applications are developed for a range of purposes from tackling obesity to improving the strategy of elite sportspeople.  We explore the area through the lens of UX (user experience).  In this unit, we focus on building our skills as UX practitioners.  Different UX methodologies to gain insights into the user's perspective are examined.  Example methodologies include 'personas' and 'user journeys'. The similiarities between UX and the relatively new field of Service Design are reviewed.

Controversial issues in the research field are debated including the sharing of information, and privacy, and designing for motivation. Problems of a technical nature are also addressed, including the development of information 'silos' and the limits of GPS technology.","This unit investigates the notion of cross-platform production, the creation of a digital product that can function across different platforms. We review the elements that create an engaging user experience (ux) and study the fundamentals of 'Persuasive Design'. To create cross-platform projects, practitioners need to know how to create, produce, execute and promote productions. Currently there are industry offers solutions for digital media practitioners to 'co-opt' solutions so that individuals and teams can create their own projects quickly and easily.  In this unit, students have the opportunity to build a game. Students acquire knowledge and experience of cross-media production in the research context of innovation management. Currently this is a burgeoning area in industry that does not have enough specialists who understand the nuances of different mediums.","The aim of this unit is to expose students to a range of management issues in the area of new technology design production.  The unit opens with coverage of project management principles relevant to new technology development.  Established and new industry approaches are critically appraised including; agile software development, product release methodology, and content strategy. Issues of intellectual property management are then reviewed. The unit closes with an investigation of employee management in the context of design, for instance, the difference between a producer, project manager and product owner.  In the area of design, often work is completed through teamwork. We discuss the complexities, advantages and disadvantages to this mode.",,,"1.

This unit articulates the intrinsic relationship between social context, meaning and language and literacy development in Early Childhood and Primary years.  Students will be taught to understand how children, as readers and writers, speakers and listeners, use and modify language and literacy for different purposes in a range of contexts. Students will learn how language and literacy does not occur as isolated skills, rather as part of how young children express themselves and they are unique to each child.","This unit explores the complex factors that influence children and young people's development and the implications for educators. Students develop their understanding through an examination of human development theories within a contemporary appreciation for interconnected individual, community and global influences for sustaining development and personal and planetary wellbeing. Through critique of frameworks for describing human development students consider how these have influenced, or are likely to influence, educational practices. Students are introduced to key approaches for fostering children and young people's development and are supported to develop their capacity to use theory to examine contemporary educational issues as well as in their own education practices.","This unit introduces you to learning in and through The Arts through an exploration of creative approaches. These approaches will promote effective understanding of the Arts, with a focus on the areas of music, drama, dance, visual and media arts. Students will engage in meaningful self-expression, communication and will gain an understanding of diverse cultures and traditions through a range of arts-based experiences that are underpinned by Arts learning theory.","In this unit, pre-service teachers undertake a period of teaching in an early childhood setting with children under three years of age. Pre-service teachers will engage in pedagogical documentation to build curriculum responsive to infant, toddlers, and families. Connections will be made illustrating contexts of caregiving; vision, strategy, and innovation in curriculum planning with infants and toddlers; understanding the power of relationships in working with infants, toddlers, families, and communities; and demonstrating practices and policy development reflective of infants and toddlers as capable and competent.","Dominant understandings of child development as defined in policy documents and curriculum frameworks view children from a narrow, normalised perspective often with no regard for diversity and context. In this unit, pre-service teachers will critically engage with major theorists and theories regarding children and childhoods (3-8 years) grounded in meaning-making, complexity, multiplicity, and context. As part of this work, pre-service teachers will analyse and debate related research and contemporary issues including transition. Pre-service teachers will utilise pedagogical documentation to inform  curriculum creation based in context, complexity, and meaning-making. This unit includes placements with children 3-5 years (10 days in the 3-5 age group).","1.

Our graduate diploma allows graduates of degree programs to become early-childhood teachers. You'll engage with units focused on children from birth to five years, learning how teaching practice can include children and families as capable participants in education.","public or private kindergartens (preschool)/ long-day-care centres/ early-childhood centres in the state of Victoria, Australia.",Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,"Early Childhood Development, Learning and Teaching 1",Early Childhood Curriculum and Pedagogy 1: the Sciences,"Contemporary Issues, Social Contexts of Learning and Social Justice",Languages and Literacy in Early Childhood,"Early Childhood Development, Learning and Teaching 2",Early Childhood Curriculum and Pedagogy 2: the Arts,Professional Issues,Inclusive Practice in Education,,,"Dominant understandings of child development as defined in policy documents and curriculum frameworks view children from a narrow, normalised perspective often with no regard for diversity and context. In this unit, pre-service teachers will critically engage with major theorists and theories regarding children and childhoods (0-8 years) grounded in meaning-making, complexity, multiplicity, and context. As part of this work, pre-service teachers will analyse and debate related research and contemporary issues including transition. Pre-service teachers will utilise pedagogical documentation to build curriculum that is responsive to infant, toddlers, pre-schoolers, school-aged children and families. Connections will be made by illustrating contexts of education and caregiving; vision, strategy, and innovation in curriculum planning with infants and toddlers, pre-schoolers and school-age children; understanding the power of relationships in working with infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, school-aged children, families, and communities; and demonstrating practices and policy development reflective of all children as capable and competent. This unit includes professional experience placements with children aged birth-2 (15 days) and 3-8 years (15 days in the 3-5 age group and 5 days in a primary school F-Yr 2).","Preservice teachers will build their knowledge of how languages are articulated in early childhood centres of Reggio Emilia, Italy as a means for young children to express themselves as human beings. As part of the unit, pre-service teachers will engage with the languages of maths, science, and technology developing an understanding of the structures of each of these languages and how these languages can inspire multi-disciplinary experiences for young children to make meaning of their worlds. Additionally, this unit will interrogate dominant understandings of physical activity and health as defined in policy documents, stage development theories, and curriculum frameworks that teach about movement through concepts of exercise, fitness, movement skills, and physical literacy. This unit focuses on constructing early childhood pedagogies that think with moving, rather than about movement, as pre-service students consider how moving happens in ways that do not fit pre-existing [or inherited] criteria for teaching, understanding, or describing movement. Intentional working with movement through inquiry and wonder offers students an experience in exploring how children move with/in the world, and how this informs teaching and learning that is complex, ethical, and political.","This unit introduces pre-service teachers to the historical and philosophical structures that shape contemporary life. By focusing on the forces that inform these structures, this unit provides pre-service teachers with the conceptual tools necessary to meaningfully situate themselves within the discourse of the history and philosophy of early childhood education. In addition, preservice teachers will engage formally and informally with place as a means of moving towards a reconciled and respectful teaching and learning practices in early childhood settings. Students will formulate an understanding of a diverse range of scholarship and contemporary research paradigms that respond to a range of educational contexts and situations, both locally and globally.","This unit focuses on making meaning through language and literacy when children (including children with English as an additional language) are viewed as capable. Through this perspective, children's approaches to learning are understood as complex, offering ways to build on children's experiences and understandings. Underpinning this unit is the recognition that language and literacy are a social act, representative of power in navigating life. Meaning making in regard to language and literacy includes experiences that hold purpose in rich, thoughtful environments and which include critical and multi-literacy experiences. Language and literacy does not occur as isolated skills, rather as part of how young children express themselves and they are unique to each child.","Preservice teachers will undertake an extended period of professional experience that is the final preparation to enter the teaching profession as activist and critical teachers that enact the broad justice principles of social inclusion and respecting difference. Preservice teachers will undertake 15 days of professional experience in a funded kindergarten program, continuing on from the 10 days undertaken in ECE6007. During the 15 days, preservice teachers will work collaboratively with staff, families and the community. Preservice teachers will articulate and connect their philosophical and theoretical standpoints to generate illustrations of practice in the domains of teaching; Professional Knowledge, Professional Practice and Professional Engagement.","This unit focuses on the languages of aesthetics and poetics from a philosophical perspective. These philosophical understandings inform how languages are articulated in early childhood centres of Reggio Emilia, Italy as a means for young children to express themselves as human beings. As part of the unit, pre-service teachers will engage with the languages of dance, music, and dramatic arts, developing an understanding of the structures of each of these languages and how these languages can inspire multi-disciplinary experiences for young children to make meaning of their worlds. Additionally, this unit will explore art materials as a way to reconsider taken-for-granted responses to materials and ideas in early childhood. Using materials as a mode of inquiry, pre-service teachers will investigate what materials do and how materials are joint participants in early childhood pedagogies. Through critical and reflective material inquiry that includes engaging with place from Aboriginal standpoints, pre-service teachers will examine their own attitudes towards visual and creative arts; develop an understanding of, and skills in, a range of early childhood visual and creative arts and technology experiences; and employ these understandings, attitudes and skills to suit the sociomaterial, sociocultural and aesthetic needs of the young child.","This unit prepares pre-service teachers to lead and manage in early childhood settings. Through the frame of advocacy and activism, pre-service teachers will develop knowledge and skills to work ethically with staff, families and communities within the operational and compliance systems in early childhood settings.","This unit provides an opportunity for pre-service teachers to critically engage as activist reflective practitioners and extend their view of the child as capable in terms of disability, inclusion, and diversity, offering the perspective of children with special rights. This builds on the understanding and acknowledgement that all children have rights (for example, right to be heard, right to contribute, right to learn). This unit examines the rights of children in terms of diversity, equity, and social justice and engages with responsive teaching practices that support inclusion, equity, and diversity. Reviewing related early childhood policy will also be part of the unit, further contributing to curriculum decision-making and foundational understanding of social justice in terms of teacher identity.",,,"1.

Questions of educational purposes in contemporary society and approaches to educational research will be raised as part of discussions of social justice and sustainability, helping to map the broad terrain of education, care and training sectors. It is possible for the unit coordinator to specify prior to the unit offering particular issues for focus or to negotiate with a group to cover particular interests. A range of readings will contribute to building a digital archive that reflects a range of sources, media and perspectives. A discussion board, wiki or blog for the unit will be used to encourage critical discussion among participants.

This is a compulsory commencing core unit for students in the Masters of Education.","In this unit theories and processes of evaluation for use in various learning settings are presented. The meaning of evaluation and the importance of evaluation goals and objectives are explained and various evaluation models and their appropriate use analysed. The particular evaluation processes that are discussed include experimental, goal oriented, decision-focused, user oriented and responsive evaluation and the basic distinctions between formative (focusing on actual process) and summative evaluation (focusing on final product). The processes for conducting outcome-based evaluations, including the importance of ethics in an evaluation investigation and the methods of data collection and analysis and report writing, are considered.","This unit focuses on innovation and planned change at individual, enterprise and societal levels with a specific emphasis on education in various learning settings, including the workplace and community. It examines values underlying particular innovations and models and strategies for developing, promoting, disseminating and implementing change and factors affecting adoption and institutionalisation. 'Innovation' is synonymous with change and how people and organisations address change is incorporated into the study. The unit includes: the purposes and goals of innovation; theories that inform a culture of innovation; values underpinning change; change and innovation at individual, local, organisational and global levels; strategies for developing innovative education and training practices; professional development models for transformation; strategies for developing communities of inquiry and professional learning teams; case studies of innovation in community learning settings, workplaces and educational and training institutions.","In this unit of study students explore a wide range of fundamental theories of learning, following the development of learning and teaching through the 20th and early 21st Century. These ideas are considered for relevance in the present day contexts, and personal histories, of the participants. Through a process of analysis, comparison and prediction based on the various learning theories and perspectives, participants will construct a stronger understanding of the process of learning, and the role of the teacher, with particular consideration of 21st century learning requirements and the use of emergent technologies.","Students will apply the process of teaching and learning in an online learning environment, evaluating effective online communications technologies, working with online classroom dynamics, comparing learning management systems, producing e-learning content, and investigating emerging trends of e-learning in educational settings. The unit will investigate the dynamic congruence of teaching and learning pedagogies in using e-learning technologies and flexible delivery.","This unit of study addresses issues of wellbeing in the context of educational settings. The focus of the unit is to investigate the factors that contribute to the ability of individuals, groups and organisations to flourish. The unit will draw on a range of research findings from the discipline of Positive Psychology (Seligman et al.) and examine their applications in educational settings. The unit will offer participants the opportunity to explore a range of topics contributing to wellbeing including resilience, flow, positive emotions, happiness, self-esteem and self-efficacy, beliefs as self-fulfilling prophecies, the pitfalls of perfectionism, goal setting and the use of character strengths. Students will explore these themes in practical ways related to their own educational contexts.","This unit of study will include consideration of the social and cultural contexts that influence curriculum and pedagogy in education and training settings. Theoretical and practical considerations will be drawn upon to investigate and critique how political, economic, social and cultural factors surround and infuse curriculum and pedagogy. Ways to develop socially just curriculum and pedagogy, and the grounds for doing so, will be explored with specific reference to how the intended is not necessarily the actual curriculum in settings of practice. Pedagogical practices to engage students across a range of social contexts, including active participation by teachers, students and parents in curriculum review and development processes, will be an integral component in considering both the theory and practice of education for social justice.","In this unit of study students enhance their skills and knowledge by exploring a particular field of education and/or training that they regard as directly related to their own interests. Through negotiation with a mentor, students identify a particular theoretical and/or professional interest they have and then embark on a guided, largely independent in-depth critical study related to their interest. Students have a level of independence and flexibility in how they construct and present their learning. The study may stem from material introduced in other coursework units, professional contexts or link to the students' intended research topic depending on what stage they are up to in their course of study. Aspects of social justice, sustainability and/or communities of learning that underpin the Master of Education should inform the study.","In this unit, theoretical concepts behind post-colonial, decolonising and Indigenous responses to formalised teaching and learning. A historical overview of colonial education provides students with critical language and concepts to make connections to national empire building and the production of colonial identities in compulsory schooling, early childhood education, vocational, adult and higher education. Students investigate how previous colonies of the European empires have sought independence, with focus on post-colonial and Indigenous theorists' descriptions of challenges in decolonising teaching and learning. Considering the key issues of self-determination, sovereignty and the rights of colonised and Indigenous peoples in education, students explore the production of pedagogical and curriculum materials that have embedded Indigenous and post-colonial ways of knowing and knowledge. The contribution of Indigenous and Post-Colonial theorists provides alternative standpoints and critiques of learning and teaching in a 'global' 21st century.",,"1.

This unit aims to develop understanding for the cultures, histories and languages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and to use this knowledge in the promotion of reconciliation. You will develop an understanding of the long history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies and cultures as well as their more recent history over the past 200 years. This includes developing an awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and knowledge sources. A second perspective is to examine current issues in Australian society for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders such as cultural identities, contemporary cultures, linguistic backgrounds and education. Thirdly, you will consider the teaching and learning implications of these, examining ways to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives in education across the early and middle years, and develop strategies for inclusion to effectively meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. This unit will increase your awareness of relevant international, national and local jurisdictional educational priorities and policies that impact upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's education and the inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives in teaching practice to support reconciliation and understanding for all students.","Digital technologies are ubiquitous in media, government, commerce and education. Educators need to be knowledgeable and critical users and creators of digital technologies. This unit introduces you to a range of digital technologies currently in use in education, discusses critically the ways such technologies can enhance learning, and examines in detail the limitations of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It focuses on the role of the digital world for children and emphasises the critical knowledge and skills necessary for safe, responsible and ethical use of ICTs in learning and teaching. The unit also supports student to select and use digital technologies to enhance their own learning.","This unit provides you with content knowledge for teaching Health, Physical Education, Personal and Social Learning at the early and middle years of childhood and facilitates the development of health literacy skills and knowledge required to make educational settings and communities healthy, safe and active places.  A series of individual, small group and whole group activities will assist students to build confidence in developing positive learning environments and engaging learning activities. You will develop skills and knowledge to engage in critical inquiry and determine how best to support and facilitate children's learning in the area of Health, enhance your own and others' health and activity practices, and recognise and respect the social values and identities of individuals from diverse social and cultural contexts.","The aim of this unit is to prepare students to become confident in foundational concepts of  Science Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM).

This subject continues the stream that will allow students to satisfy mathematics teacher registration.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding of numbers and measurements, motion, vectors, Newton's laws, energy, power and wave behaviour. The unit begins with a general introduction to measurements and their uncertainties. The equations for one-dimensional motion are then developed and extended to two-dimensional motion. The concept of a force is introduced leading to Newton's laws including frictional forces. Energy and momentum are then introduced leading to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The study of motion extends to simple harmonic motion and waves a study of the wave properties of sound and light.

Students work in groups where they can apply their knowledge of the basic principles to the solution of physics and basic engineering problems. The unit is run in PBL mode using the VU blended learning model. Principles underlying each of the nine main topics are presented via pre-class instructional videos that include on-line questions to determine students' understanding. This is followed by a face-to-face session where areas that students have found difficult are addressed by the instructor. The students are then presented with a group-based problem to solve based on the topic of the day. The students access library and laboratory facilities, as well as access to the instructor for further guidance if necessary in order to solve the problem. The students then present their solution to the problem to the class and instructor which is assessed.","In this unit, students will explore the role and importance of engineering in society, at both the national and international level. This will include identifying issues facing engineers such as sustainability; existing trends and practices; and innovations to meet future challenges. Students will examine the development of Engineering as a profession and look at the varying disciplines within the profession. This will enable students to establish their own learning and career goals and develop strategies to achieve those goals.

Students will also examine the activities that constitute the engineering method, a problem-solving process, and apply the method to an identified problem. Case studies will be presented to students introducing them to descriptions of real situations that provide a context for engineers to explore decision-making in the face of socio-technical issues, such as environmental, political, and ethical issues. Students will work on a number of deliverables that will require them to work both individually and collaboratively, and communicate their work and findings in oral and written forms.","This unit is based on a series of problems designed to both introduce students to systematic problem solving methods and to build on and apply knowledge introduced in other first year semester 1 units. The problems will focus on a range of issues related to engineering practice and sustainability. Students will be required to undertake data analysis and manipulation using various computing tools, including spreadsheet software and fundamental programming techniques.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding of matrix methods, first order differential equations, complex numbers and infinite series and their application to engineering problems. Students are encouraged to work in groups in tutorial classes where they can apply their lecture material to the solution of mathematical exercises and basic engineering problems.

 Calculus topics include partial derivatives, first order linear differential equations (DE's), separable DE's, integrating factor, first and second order linear DE's in engineering applications. Simple, double and complex roots of auxiliary equations will also be covered.","This unit continues with the concept of forces studied in Engineering Physics 1, beginning with a consolidation of the student's knowledge of the gravitational force and the idea of 'action at a distance'. These principles are then applied to Electrostatic Forces and the Magnetic Force produced by moving charges as well as electromagnetic induction. The unit extends the topic of energy from Engineering Physics 1 with the topic of thermodynamics including temperature, thermal expansion, heat capacity, specific and latent heat, ideal gases, work and heat in the thermal process, first law of thermodynamics and an introduction to heat engines.","This unit is based on a series of problems designed to both introduce students to the design process and to apply knowledge introduced in other Year 1 units of study. The problems will therefore emphasise creative thinking in design, generating and evaluating alternatives against a range of technical, environmental, social and economic criteria, and making the final design decisions. The unit also incorporates a module on professional drawing practice including projections and views, dimensioning, different drawing types and using computer-aided design (CAD) software.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding in the two broad areas of electrical fundamentals and statics. The following topics are covered in two parts:

Part A - Electrical Fundamentals: Part A begins with an introduction on Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. Series and parallel resistor circuits are analysed and their equivalent resistive circuits are developed. DC sources are studied. Part B examines the analysis of single and multiple loop circuits as well as voltage dividers. The Nodal Voltage method, the Principle of Superposition, Thevenin's Theorem, and equivalent circuits will be emphasised. Part A concludes with a discussion on AC circuits, household applications, diodes and voltage amplification in electrical networks.","Solid Mechanics is a fundamental subject in engineering and its principles and concepts provide a foundation for further learning in both broad and specialised engineering contexts. Engineers are required to design or analyse a variety of elements, components or structures that are often exposed to different loading conditions. An abstract and practical understanding of the mechanics of materials is therefore required. The abstract concepts of equilibrium and the compatibility of external and internal deformation in particular must be understood by every engineer.","The unit covers the behaviour, properties, performance and limitations of the most widely used construction materials such as concrete, steel, timber as well as other construction materials such as polymers and composites. In addition, the unit gives an introduction to construction equipment, techniques and OH&S requirements used by the Civil and Architectural Engineering industry.","1.

BA,Victoria University,Footscray Park,Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Mechanical Engineering),College of Engineering and Science,"17,250",,AUD,Year,4,Years,IELTS,,,6.0,,,https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/international/NHEM,English,A,"Get set for an exciting career inventing devices and generating clever solutions to engineering challenges, with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Mechanical Engineering) from VU. Mechanical engineers use their in-depth knowledge of the physical sciences and maths to improve the quality of life on Earth. Recent engineering breakthroughs include 3D printing machines, unmanned vehicles and high-performance prostheses. Our Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Mechanical Engineering) degree focuses on modelling and simulation of components, machines, processes and systems.",mechanical engineer/ design engineer/ product engineer/ product innovation engineer/ development engineer/ production engineer/ sales engineer/ systems engineer/ production manager/ engineering manager.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Algebra and Calculus,Engineering Physics 1,Engineering and the Community,Problem Solving for Engineers,Engineering Mathematics 2,Engineering Physics 2,Introduction to Engineering Design,Engineering Fundamentals,Solid Mechanics,Fluid Mechanics 1,"Introduction to the use of modern computer algebra system calculators to solve mathematical problems. Manipulate and solve various algebraic expressions. Sketch various polynomials and other functions. Extension of the number system to include complex numbers: their definition and basic operations using rectangular and polar. The binomial theorem will be used in the expansion of algebraic forms. Introduction to calculus: using rules for differentiation, and the solution of equations. Concepts of integration: the relationship between integration and differentiation, area between curves. Integration methods: integration by substitution, integration by parts. Numerical integration: trapezoidal and Simpson's rule. First order differential equations: separation of variables method and application to growth/decay problems and Newton's law of cooling. This subject continues the stream that will allow students to satisfy mathematics teacher registration.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding of numbers and measurements, motion, vectors, Newton's laws, energy, power and wave behaviour. The unit begins with a general introduction to measurements and their uncertainties. The equations for one-dimensional motion are then developed and extended to two-dimensional motion. The concept of a force is introduced leading to Newton's laws including frictional forces. Energy and momentum are then introduced leading to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The study of motion extends to simple harmonic motion and waves a study of the wave properties of sound and light.

Students work in groups where they can apply their knowledge of the basic principles to the solution of physics and basic engineering problems. The unit is run in PBL mode using the VU blended learning model. Principles underlying each of the nine main topics are presented via pre-class instructional videos that include on-line questions to determine students' understanding. This is followed by a face-to-face session where areas that students have found difficult are addressed by the instructor. The students are then presented with a group-based problem to solve based on the topic of the day. The students access library and laboratory facilities, as well as access to the instructor for further guidance if necessary in order to solve the problem. The students then present their solution to the problem to the class and instructor which is assessed.","In this unit, students will explore the role and importance of engineering in society, at both the national and international level. This will include identifying issues facing engineers such as sustainability; existing trends and practices; and innovations to meet future challenges. Students will examine the development of Engineering as a profession and look at the varying disciplines within the profession. This will enable students to establish their own learning and career goals and develop strategies to achieve those goals.

Students will also examine the activities that constitute the engineering method, a problem-solving process, and apply the method to an identified problem. Case studies will be presented to students introducing them to descriptions of real situations that provide a context for engineers to explore decision-making in the face of socio-technical issues, such as environmental, political, and ethical issues. Students will work on a number of deliverables that will require them to work both individually and collaboratively, and communicate their work and findings in oral and written forms.","This unit is based on a series of problems designed to both introduce students to systematic problem solving methods and to build on and apply knowledge introduced in other first year semester 1 units. The problems will focus on a range of issues related to engineering practice and sustainability. Students will be required to undertake data analysis and manipulation using various computing tools, including spreadsheet software and fundamental programming techniques.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding of matrix methods, first order differential equations, complex numbers and infinite series and their application to engineering problems. Students are encouraged to work in groups in tutorial classes where they can apply their lecture material to the solution of mathematical exercises and basic engineering problems.

 Calculus topics include partial derivatives, first order linear differential equations (DE's), separable DE's, integrating factor, first and second order linear DE's in engineering applications. Simple, double and complex roots of auxiliary equations will also be covered.","This unit continues with the concept of forces studied in Engineering Physics 1, beginning with a consolidation of the student's knowledge of the gravitational force and the idea of 'action at a distance'. These principles are then applied to Electrostatic Forces and the Magnetic Force produced by moving charges as well as electromagnetic induction. The unit extends the topic of energy from Engineering Physics 1 with the topic of thermodynamics including temperature, thermal expansion, heat capacity, specific and latent heat, ideal gases, work and heat in the thermal process, first law of thermodynamics and an introduction to heat engines.","This unit is based on a series of problems designed to both introduce students to the design process and to apply knowledge introduced in other Year 1 units of study. The problems will therefore emphasise creative thinking in design, generating and evaluating alternatives against a range of technical, environmental, social and economic criteria, and making the final design decisions. The unit also incorporates a module on professional drawing practice including projections and views, dimensioning, different drawing types and using computer-aided design (CAD) software.","This unit of study aims to provide a basic understanding in the two broad areas of electrical fundamentals and statics. The following topics are covered in two parts:

Part A - Electrical Fundamentals: Part A begins with an introduction on Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. Series and parallel resistor circuits are analysed and their equivalent resistive circuits are developed. DC sources are studied. Part B examines the analysis of single and multiple loop circuits as well as voltage dividers. The Nodal Voltage method, the Principle of Superposition, Thevenin's Theorem, and equivalent circuits will be emphasised. Part A concludes with a discussion on AC circuits, household applications, diodes and voltage amplification in electrical networks.","Solid Mechanics is a fundamental subject in engineering and its principles and concepts provide a foundation for further learning in both broad and specialised engineering contexts. Engineers are required to design or analyse a variety of elements, components or structures that are often exposed to different loading conditions. An abstract and practical understanding of the mechanics of materials is therefore required. The abstract concepts of equilibrium and the compatibility of external and internal deformation in particular must be understood by every engineer.","Fluid Mechanics deals with the study of the properties and movement of liquids. Fluids are found and used in every facet of our lives, ranging from the water we are so much dependent on to complex hydraulic machines. The history of fluid mechanics is as old as civilisation itself, as water has been used for centuries for irrigation, power, navigation, and so on. This unit of study aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the basic concepts of fluid mechanics, which is essential for most engineering disciplines. It would introduce and teach students numerous concepts in static fluids as well as fluids in motion. Most of these concepts would be taught using practical examples found in day-to-day life (eg. objects immersed in water, water flowing in garden hoses and pipes, pumps, etc). Practical lab experiments would be undertaken to explain these concepts using hands-on experiments and demonstrations.

Topics include: 
Hydrostatics, pressure, force on immersed surfaces; Pressure measurement, piezometers and U-tube manometers; Stability of floating bodies, Archimedes principle and metacentric height; Hydrodynamics, classification of flows, continuity, momentum and energy equations and their applications; Flow in pipes, pipe friction equations and Moody's diagram, Flow measurement in pipes (venturi meter and orifice meter); Pumps, types of pumps, performance equations, affinity laws, pumps in series and parallel, cavitation and surge.","1.

In addition, kinesiological concepts that assist in the determination of joint actions of muscles are covered. The unit will be studied with a regional anatomy orientation.","This unit focuses on the fundamental principles of research design and analysis in Exercise Science. Introductory skills and knowledge for the conduct of research are developed. Fundamental principles underpinning qualitative and quantitative experimental design including the importance of following accepted processes in statistical analyses, sampling and the making of inferences are highlighted together with the ethical recruitment, treatment and confidentiality of participants. Informed consent as a moral framework for giving due regard and respect to the subject of the research and transparency and completeness in the dissemination of knowledge are emphasised in this unit.","This unit forms a basis for the applications of knowledge in growth development and ageing in the field of Exercise and Sport Science. It aims to develop an integrated understanding of physical growth and the development of motor characteristics of humans from childhood into adulthood, including the genetic and environmental factors that interact to influence these processes and the deterioration in physical processes and motor characteristics as they age. The unit focuses on development across the lifespan to give a balanced perspective on age-related changes in human motor function.","This unit introduces students to the principles and practices of resistance training. The unit deals with systems of resistance training and exercises for various body segments and individual muscles. An understanding of muscle actions is fostered throughout the unit. Resistance training for general fitness, strength, hypertrophy and muscular endurance will be covered with students developing skills and knowledge in the use of resistance training as a modality of exercise prescription for various groups. This unit heavily emphasises practical aspects of coaching human movement in the context of resistance exercise prescription. The unit also deals with common muscular strength and endurance tests.","This unit introduces students to biomechanical concepts and relatedness to common real-world issues in field of sports and exercise. Students will learn the biomechanics terminology, fundamental problem solving and analysis techniques, and major theories. Linear and angular kinematics and kinetics concepts will be learnt through guided project work that investigates (i) linear kinematics of sports match analysis, (ii) angular kinematics and projectile motion of sports movement technique, (iii) linear and angular kinetics of human impacts during locomotion and agile movements, and (iv) friction, work and energy associated with sports equipment.","The general aim of the unit is to give students an understanding of basic concepts in human physiology. The unit will comprise a description of basic cell structures and functions for generalised and specialised cells; outline co-ordinated body functions with specific applications to the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculo-skeletal, neural, alimentary and renal systems. In addition, basic concepts in organic metabolism and energy balance will be considered.","In this unit students apply their knowledge to demonstrate an understanding of the acute physiological responses to exercise, as well as the chronic physiological responses to exercise training. The unit examines: the calculation of work, power and energy expenditure; the metabolic supply of energy during exercise; and the physiological responses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular and endocrine systems to exercise. Students are introduced to practical aspects of exercise physiology through experiments and procedures in the exercise physiology laboratory. This unit is taught from a theoretical, practical and applied perspective to enhance students' understanding of exercise physiology principles.","Sport and exercise professionals are increasingly recognising the importance of sport and exercise psychology in their work in an exercise/sport setting. This unit aims to help sport and exercise professionals understand the psychological factors that influence participation and performance in sport and exercise, and equip them with the fundamental skills needed to teach and apply interventions to promote and enhance the knowledge, participation, performance, growth and wellbeing of sport and exercise participants. Furthermore, this unit will encourage sport and exercise professionals to focus on their own self-awareness and professional growth.","This unit provides an introduction to nutrition for health, exercise and sports performance. It enables students to understand the roles of the main nutrient groups, as well as various vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements and ergogenic aids for the promotion of healthy living, prevention of chronic lifestyle-related diseases and enhancement of exercise and sport performance and recovery. Students study the influences of various diets and eating patterns on conditions such as overweight/obesity, and a diverse range of lifestyle disease. Students will understand the inter-relationships between nutrition and exercise in terms of energy balance, disordered eating and body composition assessment methods.","This unit discusses the design and delivery of exercise and physical activity services for apparently healthy individuals, including athletes. Students develop an understanding of client-centered exercise delivery, and the challenges of behaviour change that are often needed for lifelong participation in exercise and physical activity. The unit investigates how variables including the client's history of exercise, physical activity and injury, the client's goals, likes and dislikes, barriers and opportunities (eg. sociocultural, socioeconomic factors, socio-psychological, environmental), and the client's current exercise and functional capacities affect program prescription and uptake. Students learn the importance of cultural competence in the design and delivery of services. Students also develop hands-on expertise to conduct needed, appropriate assessments within the physical health-domain comprising of the major components of health-related physical fitness, in addition to the neuromotor components of balance, agility and coordination of adults. Students develop critical thinking skills to analyse the collected base-line assessment results, based on the functional capacities of clients and how these capabilities compare with normative data that can be used to plan, design and compose individualised exercise interventions. Students are exposed to the importance of developing a safe and effective demonstration and leadership of appropriate exercises and training regimes.","1.

In addition, kinesiological concepts that assist in the determination of joint actions of muscles are covered. The unit will be studied with a regional anatomy orientation.","This unit focuses on the fundamental principles of research design and analysis in Exercise Science. Introductory skills and knowledge for the conduct of research are developed. Fundamental principles underpinning qualitative and quantitative experimental design including the importance of following accepted processes in statistical analyses, sampling and the making of inferences are highlighted together with the ethical recruitment, treatment and confidentiality of participants. Informed consent as a moral framework for giving due regard and respect to the subject of the research and transparency and completeness in the dissemination of knowledge are emphasised in this unit.","This unit forms a basis for the applications of knowledge in growth development and ageing in the field of Exercise and Sport Science. It aims to develop an integrated understanding of physical growth and the development of motor characteristics of humans from childhood into adulthood, including the genetic and environmental factors that interact to influence these processes and the deterioration in physical processes and motor characteristics as they age. The unit focuses on development across the lifespan to give a balanced perspective on age-related changes in human motor function.","This unit introduces students to the principles and practices of resistance training. The unit deals with systems of resistance training and exercises for various body segments and individual muscles. An understanding of muscle actions is fostered throughout the unit. Resistance training for general fitness, strength, hypertrophy and muscular endurance will be covered with students developing skills and knowledge in the use of resistance training as a modality of exercise prescription for various groups. This unit heavily emphasises practical aspects of coaching human movement in the context of resistance exercise prescription. The unit also deals with common muscular strength and endurance tests.","This unit introduces students to biomechanical concepts and relatedness to common real-world issues in field of sports and exercise. Students will learn the biomechanics terminology, fundamental problem solving and analysis techniques, and major theories. Linear and angular kinematics and kinetics concepts will be learnt through guided project work that investigates (i) linear kinematics of sports match analysis, (ii) angular kinematics and projectile motion of sports movement technique, (iii) linear and angular kinetics of human impacts during locomotion and agile movements, and (iv) friction, work and energy associated with sports equipment.","The general aim of the unit is to give students an understanding of basic concepts in human physiology. The unit will comprise a description of basic cell structures and functions for generalised and specialised cells; outline co-ordinated body functions with specific applications to the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculo-skeletal, neural, alimentary and renal systems. In addition, basic concepts in organic metabolism and energy balance will be considered.","In this unit students apply their knowledge to demonstrate an understanding of the acute physiological responses to exercise, as well as the chronic physiological responses to exercise training. The unit examines: the calculation of work, power and energy expenditure; the metabolic supply of energy during exercise; and the physiological responses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular and endocrine systems to exercise. Students are introduced to practical aspects of exercise physiology through experiments and procedures in the exercise physiology laboratory. This unit is taught from a theoretical, practical and applied perspective to enhance students' understanding of exercise physiology principles.","Sport and exercise professionals are increasingly recognising the importance of sport and exercise psychology in their work in an exercise/sport setting. This unit aims to help sport and exercise professionals understand the psychological factors that influence participation and performance in sport and exercise, and equip them with the fundamental skills needed to teach and apply interventions to promote and enhance the knowledge, participation, performance, growth and wellbeing of sport and exercise participants. Furthermore, this unit will encourage sport and exercise professionals to focus on their own self-awareness and professional growth.","This unit provides an introduction to nutrition for health, exercise and sports performance. It enables students to understand the roles of the main nutrient groups, as well as various vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements and ergogenic aids for the promotion of healthy living, prevention of chronic lifestyle-related diseases and enhancement of exercise and sport performance and recovery. Students study the influences of various diets and eating patterns on conditions such as overweight/obesity, and a diverse range of lifestyle disease. Students will understand the inter-relationships between nutrition and exercise in terms of energy balance, disordered eating and body composition assessment methods.","This unit discusses the design and delivery of exercise and physical activity services for apparently healthy individuals, including athletes. Students develop an understanding of client-centered exercise delivery, and the challenges of behaviour change that are often needed for lifelong participation in exercise and physical activity. The unit investigates how variables including the client's history of exercise, physical activity and injury, the client's goals, likes and dislikes, barriers and opportunities (eg. sociocultural, socioeconomic factors, socio-psychological, environmental), and the client's current exercise and functional capacities affect program prescription and uptake. Students learn the importance of cultural competence in the design and delivery of services. Students also develop hands-on expertise to conduct needed, appropriate assessments within the physical health-domain comprising of the major components of health-related physical fitness, in addition to the neuromotor components of balance, agility and coordination of adults. Students develop critical thinking skills to analyse the collected base-line assessment results, based on the functional capacities of clients and how these capabilities compare with normative data that can be used to plan, design and compose individualised exercise interventions. Students are exposed to the importance of developing a safe and effective demonstration and leadership of appropriate exercises and training regimes.","1.

The unit applies the five cultural capabilities of respect, communication, safety and quality, reflection and advocacy with the aim to: recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' way of doing in the context of history, culture and diversity; engage in culturally appropriate, safe and sensitive communication that facilitates trust and the building of respectful relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; apply evidence and strengths based best practice approaches in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care; examine and reflect on how one's own culture and dominant cultural paradigms, influence perceptions and interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and to recognise that the whole health system is responsible for improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.","A robust understanding of the principles of human anatomy and physiology is fundamental to the knowledge base of health professionals. This foundational and interdisciplinary unit for students provides an introduction to the structure and function of the human body and the underpinning knowledge for subsequent units in anatomy and physiology and other health related courses. Following a brief overview of the organisation of the human body, students are introduced to anatomical terms, the chemical and structural basis of cell function, and body tissues including the integumentary system. Students are introduced to microbiology within the context of infection prevention and control. Specific topics to be addressed will include the physiological control of major organ systems including the nervous, circulatory, cardiovascular, respiratory and reproductive systems. Upon completion of the unit, students will be able to explain the integration of normal structure and function and the role of homeostatic feedback control systems in maintaining bodily functions. The aim of this unit is to provide a firm basis for further studies of physiological functioning in health and disease.","This unit expands on content from 'Anatomy and Physiology 1' of the structure and function of the human body, using homeostatic regulation of the internal environment as the ongoing theme. The endocrine and renal systems are discussed, as well as their roles in the regulation of variables such as fluid and electrolyte balance and acid-base balance. Specific topics include the major physiological systems of the human body, including the renal, endocrine, special senses, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, genetic inheritance, lymphatic and immune systems in the human body. The completion of both HBM1001 and HBM1202 Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2 units will provide a solid foundation for advanced study in physiology.","This unit aims to build in students a readiness to communicate evidence and opinions clearly in professional settings. The unit serves to clarify the expectations held regarding communication in academia and the professional world, with a focus on the specific standards applied in the disciplines and professions associated with distinct courses. It builds in students the foundational knowledge and skills needed to begin to meet those expectations. Two axes of communication are explored: unilateral communication (e.g. speech, presentation, memo, executive summary) and interactive communication (e.g. interview, committee meeting, correspondence chain, social media thread). In all cases, a primary focus is on the meeting of expectations held by the receivers of the communication. As well as offering practical support for later academic assessment, the unit also develops skills needed in senior-years practical and industry project units, as well as in other forms of community and professional engagement.","This unit will assist students to develop skills in describing the origins and concepts of public health and its relationship to contemporary public health initiatives, challenges and practices. Students will gain knowledge on health and its determinants and how these impact on public health interventions. The role of public health at each stage of the disease continuum will be used to introduce definitions and interventions that address identified health priorities.","This unit introduces students to the different sources of public health information and develops their skills in identifying, locating, retrieving and evaluating health literature based on evidence. While the emphasis of the unit is on scientific literature students will also be exposed to other sources of health information around evaluating health care claims. The unit introduces students to different research methodologies used in health care literature and further assists them to develop basic writing skills.","This unit introduces students to the Australian healthcare system and policies. It explores the public versus private health sectors and the role of the different levels of government in healthcare delivery. It demonstrates how Australian healthcare systems compare with other regional and global health systems. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the diversity of the health workforce, health management and health decision making in Australia. Students are introduced to some key international health policies that inform local health policies. It introduces health policy development process and role of stakeholders in policy.","Students will be introduced to foods and food groups, the nutrients they provide, and the Australian dietary recommendations for adult human health. This will include gaining an understanding of the sources, role and function of the macronutrients (protein, fat and carbohydrate), key micronutrients, fibre and fluid, as well as the digestion, absorption and metabolism of the macronutrients. Students will be introduced to the concepts of energy balance and the role of diet in maintaining this balance.",,,"1.

The ontological and epistemological foundations to various approaches to social research will be critically reviewed. Students will become broadly familiar with the concepts of logic and methodology and quantitative and qualitative research methods. They will be able to select a research topic(s), design research proposal(s) and adopt appropriate research methods. To emphasis skills development in research training, students will practice with (and use) commonly used social research software tools.","This unit critically reviews a variety of contemporary community development perspectives. The focus is upon understanding the context of international social, economic and political development. Students will critique how they understand their own location and how their views have been shaped by the dominant economic paradigm. The unit focuses also on various development frameworks and their stance regarding environmental sustainability, equality and human rights.  Further, the unit engages learners in a self-critique as global players in development and social change. Students interrogate practices in poverty reduction, marginalisation, community organisation and conscientisation, to develop clarity of their own praxis.","This unit of study focuses on project planning and design for community development work in a development setting. The principles of project design are examined and debated in relation to their role and application to international community development work. Students will investigate and selectively apply methodologies and techniques used in project work and its evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on participatory approaches such as Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), and the impact of gender on outcomes and development strategies. Students will critically review culturally relevant project monitoring, reporting and evaluation methodologies.","This unit explores how gender is deeply embedded in the ways we define our world and act within it, how our bodies are regulated and surveilled and hence how power enters into both the enhancement and suppression of capabilities through definitions of gendered bodies and their interactions and intersections. The gendered dimension is considered from a global perspective through the lens of human rights and how the latter attempt to intersect some traditional modes of gendered identities and interactions by injecting questions about opportunities and outcomes of a social, political, economic or cultural nature. All of this is then disseminated and applied to the work of development and community development.","This unit of study critiques key developments and debates about civil society, its history and evolving roles and functions in international community development. Students examine civil society's relationships with other actors, including other civil society organisations (CSOs), governments, international institutions and the private sector. They will critically assess the relationships between civil society in developed and developing countries, including in relation to supporting capacity building of Indigenous civil society to mobilise communities to claim rights, hold governments and authorities to account, connect communities and representatives, and plan and implement community development initiatives. Students interrogate the concept of capacity development and its relationship to processes of self-determination, democratisation and state development and consider the appropriateness and sustainability of capacity development strategies. Case studies are used to provide real world illustrations of key issues and tensions.","This unit of study debates the application of conflict resolution theory to conflicts at both group and community levels. Through this process a sophisticated, multi-layered definition of the nature of conflict will be derived. Specific processes and skills for resolving or managing conflict in a range of differing contexts are then considered, including: individual conflicts, multi-party and multi-issue conflicts, intragroup conflicts, cultural and intergroup conflicts, and disputes in neighbourhood and workplace contexts. Particular emphasis will be placed on the awareness of difference and its effect in disputes, and on the students' own styles in dealing with conflict.","This unit of study examines social and political issues in contemporary Asia and the Pacific, two socially and politically diverse and dynamic regions. Key debates within the regions are analysed, including debates about culture and identity; and questions about development; and the disparities of wealth and poverty. Nation-states in these regions are studied comparatively while the place of the region in the globe is also examined. Global factors examined include work and commodity chains, migration, and the role of international organisations. Finally, the unit considers Australia's position in relation to these two regions, interrogating some of the ways that 'Asia' and ""Pacific' are interpreted, focusing upon critiques by Asian and Pacific scholars.","The key focus of this unit is to prepare and empower participants to work with communities in a variety of contexts to achieve effective student learning and action for environmental sustainability. The unit covers the range of key sustainability issues important for communities, at local and international levels, including reducing environmental impacts on water, waste management, greenhouse gas production and biodiversity. Students will learn the most up-to-date methods for engaging communities to achieve productive, equitable and effective change for sustainability. Further, the unit emphasises developing appropriate approaches to community sustainability, given the diversity of contexts and challenges and interconnections between community development issues. Students may engage in a practical community and sustainability project or a critical investigation of a project aiming to assess how holistically it considered issues of sustainability.","In this interdisciplinary unit students examine migration as part of broader changes at the national, regional and global levels, flagged by the UN and other multilateral bodies as a core component of the human development agenda. Students compare a variety of different forms of migration, including forced, labour and temporary migration. The unit analyses key issues relating to migration, including in particular, the roles played by political organisations, social networks and transnationalism within the migratory experience. In looking at these issues, students critically engage with key debates around culture, race, diaspora and identity that are vital to understanding the social and political context of migration. Included here are debates pertaining to cultural pluralism, acculturation and multiculturalism. The complexities of identity and community making in the context of migration are also examined.","This unit of study investigates and appraises different forms of organisational structures involved in organising and mobilising for social change in Australia and overseas. These range from service providing government departments and semi-governmental authorities to various types of non-governmental organisations, co-operatives and community businesses. Students critique relevant theories, and through reflective development of their practical skills in selected areas of organisational management, praxis will be enhanced.","1.

This unit:

Provides students with a working foundation in the technical structure of Australian legal systems and legal reasoning, using applied practical teaching and learning methods;



Exposes students to ways of making sense of Australian legal systems and legal process in a legal academic way, using selected contexts from criminal and private law;

Introduces students to the broader contexts in which legal issues may arise, including the political, social, historical, philosophical and economic contexts; and

Inducts students in the ways of the lawyer, including and legal reasoning and appropriate language use and structure

using reflective, applied and theory-based teaching and learning methods.","Contracts 1 provides students with the knowledge of the law of contract. The law of contract provides the rules which determine when one party is liable to another under or in connection with a contract. This is an extremely important area of law as contracts are created on a daily basis and form the basis of most commercial arrangements. Students will be exposed to relevant law of contract which govern the processes of formation of contract, interpretation of contract, performance as well as termination of contract.","This is a foundation unit for law students and others studying in the justice professions and involves three related areas - understanding research as an active, critical and reflective process, identifying, understanding and utilising research sources in a legal studies context, and developing legal analytical skills. Research is a fundamental skill which enables you to improve your knowledge, understanding and action in daily life. In an academic and legal setting, it enables you to locate contemporary law and academic knowledge, then critically evaluate the content and credibility of sources. The unit introduces the concept and process of research, encouraging students to develop their critical reading and analytical skills. It introduces the academic integrity principles and citation systems that scholarly writing must employ. Like any discipline, law uses its own language and media forms and this unit is designed to enable students to master these. Legal scholars must be familiar with primary sources of law and the specific ways in which academic and legal authorities must be recorded in legal writing. The unit introduces students to the broad variety of secondary and primary legal sources and the manner in which they may be both located and cited. Legal scholarship involves an understanding of the relationship between primary legal sources and the dynamic between primary and secondary legal sources. This unit provides students with the legal knowledge and analytical skills necessary to master scholarly legal analysis. By focusing on the technical and conceptual skills underlying legal research, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throught their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","The unit of study will examine the principles of negligence and its role in allocating liability for personal injuries and economic loss. Defences, remedies and the assessment of damages for negligence will also be examined. The unit of study will also consider the appropriate context within which alternative compensation schemes might operate. Other torts will also be considered during the unit of study including areas such as trespass, defamation and nuisance.","This unit together with Criminal Investigation Procedure and Sentencing satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal Law is a core law subject for the LLB degree. It covers substantive criminal law. Substantive criminal law refers to the law that creates criminal offences. Offences can generally be categorised into offences against the person (homicide offences, assault, sexual offences), property offences (burglary, theft, obtaining financial advantage or property by deception), inchoate offences (conspiracy, incitement or attempt in relation to an existing offence) and complicity (the extent to which a person can be held liable for the actions of another person). Of course, an understanding of criminal liability also requires an understanding of defences.","This unit together with Criminal Law satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal procedure refers to the law and practices of investigating and enforcing criminal law. Sentencing covers the sanctions imposed on offenders in enforcement. It covers: courts exercising criminal jurisdiction; classification of offences; search, seizure and forensic processes; police questioning; arrest; commencing criminal proceedings; bail; committal hearings; pleadings and plea negotiations; and, the criminal trial including the functions of judges and juries, prosecutors and defence lawyers. It also covers the legal framework for sentencing including: the sources of law; the principles of parsimony, proportionality, parity and totality; sentencing hearings; public and victim input; and, control of sentencing discretions. They are considered in the context of philosophical concepts and public policies balancing the community's interest in the prevention of crime and protecting the liberties of the individual and in competing concepts of justice and the role of the legislative, executive, judicial branches of government.","This unit of study focuses on developing skills in good legal writing and drafting. It includes principles of plain English, effective written communication and drafting legal documents, including court documents and how to apply them in practice. The unit will cover the function and operation of a document, stages in preparing a document and structuring a document. Students will also learn about style, appearance, content and presentation of documents. The unit will further address legal rules of construction that apply to documents such as agreements, the use of precedents and rules of evidence and procedure that apply to court documents.","Familiarity with key concepts and theories of law, and the ability to interpret legislation, are essential skills in understanding law and legal systems. This unit of study will examine the philosophy of law in historical and contemporary context. Natural law and legal positivist theories are explored with reference to other disciplines (such as history, philosophy, theology, sociology and political science). The unit introduces further approaches to legal theory including legal realism, sociological legal theories, historical and anthropological theories, and critical legal theories. Foundational legal concepts of rights, duties, justice and punishment are considered in theoretical and normative terms. This course will provide an advanced study of the rules and principles governing statutory interpretation and will consider how statutes have been read and are being read by the Australian courts.  The concepts, interpretative criteria, and the techniques of the common law are examined with reference to federal and state legislation. This unit will enable students to interpret statutes and to engage critically with the main arguments that characterise modern interpretive practice. By focusing on the theoretical issues underlying law and legal systems, and the theoretical and technical basis of statutory interpretation, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throughout their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","The focus of this unit is the concept and characteristics of rights and interests in land: their creation, acquisition, enjoyment and disposal, specifically in the Torrens title registration system in Victoria. This unit covers the Real Property component of the Priestley 11 area ""Real and Personal Property"" under the Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015.","The aim of this unit is to introduce students to the corporation as a separate entity, the concept of corporate regulation and practical areas of Australian corporate law (including incorporation, the administration and management of companies, directors' duties, share capital and membership, the company constitution, company contracts, shareholder rights and remedies, dividends, company credit and security arrangements, fundraising through shares issues and by debt, and the  insolvency and winding of companies.). The unit enables students to explore, research, analyse and debate some of the significant contemporary issues in Australian corporate law, complementing the LLB course by preparing students to work in the globalised, sophisticated 21st century commercial world, whether as a commercial lawyer, a corporate lawyer or in another role where company and commercial law principles are relevant.","1.

The unit explores: the changing nature of what we understand as crime; traditional and mainstream explanations for why people commit crime; the emergence of academic challenges to mainstream explanations of criminality; victims and victimology; inequality and social difference; and crime and the media. In addition, the unit explores the way in which information and statistics on crime are collected. Students will be encouraged to understand the connection between criminological approaches and practical responses to crime.","This unit introduces students to the history, sociology, and politics of policing and corrections. The unit examines the administration of justice from the reporting and detection of crime through to the correctional regimes of offenders. It highlights important debates around issues of accountability, and traces the historical shape of policing and corrections that have led to the features and characteristics of contemporary institutions and practices. In addition to exploring the domain of policy, we focus on a number of key challenges and issues that confront police and corrections officers in their day to day working lives. The unit is underpinned by an interest in questions around balancing the power of the state, identifying the rights and protections afforded citizens through the 'rule of law' and democratic safeguards, and exploring the powers that are exercised in the processes of investigating crime and sanctioning individuals.","This unit together with Criminal Investigation Procedure and Sentencing satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015.

It introduces students to the effects of disadvantage on criminal behaviour and policing and legal responses to disorder.  The unit reviews the roles that gender, race, ethnicity and class play in the criminal justice system and explores the reasons why some groups are over-represented in offending and incarceration rates.Students will work through contemporary issues such as gender-based violence, indigenous incarceration, policing and bias and the unequal application of the criminal law for crimes related to disadvantage.","Corporate crime is a significant economic drain on society. In this unit we shall examine the main forms of corporate crime ranging from company and security offences, collusion and corruption, taxation, consumer affairs and safety, and the environment.  Case studies will be used to consider the determination of offences and the circumstances that lead to corporate crime.    The unit will then consider the criminal liability of corporations, as well as their directors. The unit will then apply consider international examples of misconduct including misconduct in the context of corporate negligence as well as financial and accounting fraud.  Policies, governance regulations, ethical guidelines and laws aimed at detecting and preventing corporate crime will be evaluated.  The unit will conclude by considering the treatment of white collar offending in sentencing and comparing white collar criminal responsibility, to the civil penalty scheme, and the rationale and overlap between the two schemes.","1.

This course is available to bachelor degree graduates from any discipline. Study with VU to get the comprehensive training and hands-on experience needed to launch your legal career. As well as exploring legal practice and ethics, this course covers all major areas of law, including:",legal practitioner (barrister or solicitor)/ in-house legal counsel/ lawyer/ policy adviser/ business manager/company administrator/ public administrator/ teacher/ law reform research officer/ legal adviser/ human rights advocate.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Australian Legal System in Context,Contracts 1,Legal Research Methods,Torts,Legal Interpretation,Criminal Law,"Criminal Investigation, Procedure and Sentencing",Legal Writing and Drafting,Real Property Law,Corporations Law,"This foundation unit introduces students to the 'nuts and bolts' of the Australian Legal system and legal reasoning. In addition, it offers a selection of socio-political contexts within which to situate and critically evaluate the contemporary Australian legal system.  This unit provides a foundation for the study of law at Victoria University and, as such, successful completion is a pre-requisite for progression through the Law course.

This unit:

Provides students with a working foundation in the technical structure of Australian legal systems and legal reasoning, using applied practical teaching and learning methods;



Exposes students to ways of making sense of Australian legal systems and legal process in a legal academic way, using selected contexts from criminal and private law;

Introduces students to the broader contexts in which legal issues may arise, including the political, social, historical, philosophical and economic contexts; and

Inducts students in the ways of the lawyer, including and legal reasoning and appropriate language use and structure

using reflective, applied and theory-based teaching and learning methods.","Contracts 1 provides students with the knowledge of the law of contract. The law of contract provides the rules which determine when one party is liable to another under or in connection with a contract. This is an extremely important area of law as contracts are created on a daily basis and form the basis of most commercial arrangements. Students will be exposed to relevant law of contract which govern the processes of formation of contract, interpretation of contract, performance as well as termination of contract.","This is a foundation unit for law students and others studying in the justice professions and involves three related areas - understanding research as an active, critical and reflective process, identifying, understanding and utilising research sources in a legal studies context, and developing legal analytical skills. Research is a fundamental skill which enables you to improve your knowledge, understanding and action in daily life. In an academic and legal setting, it enables you to locate contemporary law and academic knowledge, then critically evaluate the content and credibility of sources. The unit introduces the concept and process of research, encouraging students to develop their critical reading and analytical skills. It introduces the academic integrity principles and citation systems that scholarly writing must employ. Like any discipline, law uses its own language and media forms and this unit is designed to enable students to master these. Legal scholars must be familiar with primary sources of law and the specific ways in which academic and legal authorities must be recorded in legal writing. The unit introduces students to the broad variety of secondary and primary legal sources and the manner in which they may be both located and cited. Legal scholarship involves an understanding of the relationship between primary legal sources and the dynamic between primary and secondary legal sources. This unit provides students with the legal knowledge and analytical skills necessary to master scholarly legal analysis. By focusing on the technical and conceptual skills underlying legal research, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throught their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","The unit of study will examine the principles of negligence and its role in allocating liability for personal injuries and economic loss. Defences, remedies and the assessment of damages for negligence will also be examined. The unit of study will also consider the appropriate context within which alternative compensation schemes might operate. Other torts will also be considered during the unit of study including areas such as trespass, defamation and nuisance.","Familiarity with key concepts and theories of law, and the ability to interpret legislation, are essential skills in understanding law and legal systems. This unit of study will examine the philosophy of law in historical and contemporary context. Natural law and legal positivist theories are explored with reference to other disciplines (such as history, philosophy, theology, sociology and political science). The unit introduces further approaches to legal theory including legal realism, sociological legal theories, historical and anthropological theories, and critical legal theories. Foundational legal concepts of rights, duties, justice and punishment are considered in theoretical and normative terms. This course will provide an advanced study of the rules and principles governing statutory interpretation and will consider how statutes have been read and are being read by the Australian courts.  The concepts, interpretative criteria, and the techniques of the common law are examined with reference to federal and state legislation. This unit will enable students to interpret statutes and to engage critically with the main arguments that characterise modern interpretive practice. By focusing on the theoretical issues underlying law and legal systems, and the theoretical and technical basis of statutory interpretation, the unit seeks to provide a guide which students can return to for reference throughout their course and to develop skills that can be built upon in subsequent units of study.","This unit together with Criminal Investigation Procedure and Sentencing satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal Law is a core law subject for the LLB degree. It covers substantive criminal law. Substantive criminal law refers to the law that creates criminal offences. Offences can generally be categorised into offences against the person (homicide offences, assault, sexual offences), property offences (burglary, theft, obtaining financial advantage or property by deception), inchoate offences (conspiracy, incitement or attempt in relation to an existing offence) and complicity (the extent to which a person can be held liable for the actions of another person). Of course, an understanding of criminal liability also requires an understanding of defences.","This unit together with Criminal Law satisfies the prescribed area of knowledge for Criminal Law and Procedure as set out in Schedule 1 Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015. 

Criminal procedure refers to the law and practices of investigating and enforcing criminal law. Sentencing covers the sanctions imposed on offenders in enforcement. It covers: courts exercising criminal jurisdiction; classification of offences; search, seizure and forensic processes; police questioning; arrest; commencing criminal proceedings; bail; committal hearings; pleadings and plea negotiations; and, the criminal trial including the functions of judges and juries, prosecutors and defence lawyers. It also covers the legal framework for sentencing including: the sources of law; the principles of parsimony, proportionality, parity and totality; sentencing hearings; public and victim input; and, control of sentencing discretions. They are considered in the context of philosophical concepts and public policies balancing the community's interest in the prevention of crime and protecting the liberties of the individual and in competing concepts of justice and the role of the legislative, executive, judicial branches of government.","This unit of study focuses on developing skills in good legal writing and drafting. It includes principles of plain English, effective written communication and drafting legal documents, including court documents and how to apply them in practice. The unit will cover the function and operation of a document, stages in preparing a document and structuring a document. Students will also learn about style, appearance, content and presentation of documents. The unit will further address legal rules of construction that apply to documents such as agreements, the use of precedents and rules of evidence and procedure that apply to court documents.","The focus of this unit is the concept and characteristics of rights and interests in land: their creation, acquisition, enjoyment and disposal, specifically in the Torrens title registration system in Victoria. This unit covers the Real Property component of the Priestley 11 area ""Real and Personal Property"" under the Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015.","The aim of this unit is to introduce students to the corporation as a separate entity, the concept of corporate regulation and practical areas of Australian corporate law (including incorporation, the administration and management of companies, directors' duties, share capital and membership, the company constitution, company contracts, shareholder rights and remedies, dividends, company credit and security arrangements, fundraising through shares issues and by debt, and the  insolvency and winding of companies.). The unit enables students to explore, research, analyse and debate some of the significant contemporary issues in Australian corporate law, complementing the LLB course by preparing students to work in the globalised, sophisticated 21st century commercial world, whether as a commercial lawyer, a corporate lawyer or in another role where company and commercial law principles are relevant.","1.

Students are introduced to microbiology within the context of infection prevention and control. Specific topics to be addressed will include the physiological control of major organ systems including the nervous, circulatory, cardiovascular, respiratory and reproductive systems. Upon completion of the unit, students will be able to explain the integration of normal structure and function and the role of homeostatic feedback control systems in maintaining bodily functions. The aim of this unit is to provide a firm basis for further studies of physiological functioning in health and disease.","Aligned with quality and safety principles, opportunities are provided for students to explore and develop nursing knowledge and foundational skills for the provision of person-centred care, paying attention to the older person and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, other cultures and people of diversity.  Key concepts to be addressed include numeracy skills, communication, and using the clinical reasoning cycle in the assessment, and management of patient functional status to promote patient safety. In addition, privacy, dignity, empowerment and promotion of patient comfort will be addressed.","This unit aims to introduce students undertaking a health-related course to the capabilities required to deliver culturally safe health care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by critically reflecting on the concept of cultural safety to deliver safe, accessible and responsive healthcare that is free from racism. The unit applies the five cultural capabilities of respect, communication, safety and quality, reflection and advocacy with the aim to: recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' way of doing in the context of history, culture and diversity; engage in culturally appropriate, safe and sensitive communication that facilitates trust and the building of respectful relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; apply evidence and strengths based best practice approaches in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care; examine and reflect on how one's own culture and dominant cultural paradigms, influence perceptions and interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and to recognise that the whole health system is responsible for improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.","This unit expands on content from 'Anatomy and Physiology 1' of the structure and function of the human body, using homeostatic regulation of the internal environment as the ongoing theme. The endocrine and renal systems are discussed, as well as their roles in the regulation of variables such as fluid and electrolyte balance and acid-base balance. Specific topics include the major physiological systems of the human body, including the renal, endocrine, special senses, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, genetic inheritance, lymphatic and immune systems in the human body. The completion of both HBM1001 and HBM1202 Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2 units will provide a solid foundation for advanced study in physiology.","In this unit, students will use person-centred care, therapeutic intraprofessional and interprofessional communication, safety and quality principles, to further develop knowledge and foundational skills introduced in previous units to support individuals across the lifespan, paying attention to the older adult.  Students will draw from knowledge gained in both anatomy and physiology units to undertake comprehensive and systematic health assessments, implement appropriate evidence-based interventions and evaluate outcomes, and document findings using digital health. Students will examine specific physiological, psychological and cultural aspects of an individual's nursing care with attention to individuals from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, other cultures and people of diversity. Early detection of deteriorating patient status and basic life support will be covered. The principles of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will be introduced as the foundation for pharmacotherapeutics and quality use of medicines.","This unit aims to introduce the beginning nurse to primary health care across the lifespan and its application to nursing contexts on regional, national and international levels. The unit applies the areas of primary health, epidemiology and population health, inter-professional practice and primary health care designed to address the health care priorities of specific populations. The health of populations will be examined, including the influence of political, environmental, geographic and economic factors within Australia and at regional, national and global levels.
The unit explores the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, other cultures and people of diversity and the evolution of how different groups become disadvantaged, based on ethnicity and citizenship status, and diversity including gender, sexuality and class. The unit takes a person-centred care approach addressing legal and ethical codes of conduct and the role of advocacy in nursing practice. The unit introduces the student to a number of communication approaches, and seeks to illustrate the application of digital health and telehealth as methods of communication and ways of reducing the tyranny of distance in health care.","Students will apply nursing knowledge and skills gained in previous units to professional practice in a healthcare setting. Aligned with quality and safety principles, students will demonstrate the provision of safe, person-centred care within their scope of practice. They will operate under the supervision of a Registered Nurse and will receive feedback on their professional practice. Before commencing placement, students will be asked to provide mandatory documentation for allocations as part of DHHS requirements for PEP.
Placement will occur in two parts. Initially students will undertake 40 hours of placement following HNB1102 Foundations in Nursing 1. In the second part students will undertake 7 hours of simulation in the first week, then three weeks of PEP (120 Hours) after successfully completing HNB1205 Foundations in Nursing 
2. Students will remain on a PL grade until 160 hours of PEP have been successfully completed.
NB: In the event of students being unable to complete part A (40 hours), students will be able to complete the total of 160 hours in one placement.","This unit explores person-centred care of patients bridging the lifespan from infant to the older adult. The unit will examine acute and chronic disorders integrating the pathophysiological processes, progression and complications to enhance understanding of the associated nursing care. Students will be introduced to treatment options inclusive of pharmacotherapeutics and quality use of medicines management, highlighting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of relevant medications utilised for acute exacerbations and chronic management, alongside relevant nursing care practices specific to medication interventions. Students will enhance their understanding of cultural competence when nursing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, other cultures and people of diversity, across health contexts. Through the use of clinical nursing laboratories and simulations, students will be guided through contemporary nursing practices, including: bridging the theory-practice gap through the use of teamwork; patient scenarios; digital health with emphasis on critical thinking; and, clinical reasoning. This approach will assist the student in understanding appropriate nursing care and management, the importance of collaborative and patient centred communication, ethical and legal implications and the evidence underpinning best practice.","This unit explores person-centred care in mental health bridging the lifespan from infant to older adult. The unit will examine mental health disorders integrating neurobiology, pathophysiology and population health to enhance the students understanding of mental illness. Students will be introduced to policy and legislative frameworks that govern service provision in mental health settings. Using biopsychosocial frameworks, they will apply critical thinking and clinical reasoning to formulate nursing assessment and management of people with selected mental health conditions across the lifespan. Nursing management will be informed by the principle of partnering with consumers and carers, knowledge from lived experience and human rights, and cultural safety. Students will develop their therapeutic and professional communication skills.","1.

DIP,Victoria University,Footscray Park,Graduate Diploma in Project Management,College of Engineering and Science,"16,100",,AUD,Year,1,Year,IELTS,,,6.5,,,https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/international/NGPM,English,A,"Prepare for a rewarding project-management role, or learn new skills for your current project-management position, with a graduate qualification from VU. The Graduate Diploma in Project Management is one of a suite of courses designed for current or potential project managers in industry. You’ll learn specialised project management principles and techniques. You can apply the skills you learn during this course to projects in sectors including: The internationally-recognised A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) underpins all our project-management teaching. We  have strong industry connections, which give you access to current work-based scenarios. These combine for a practical, usable and valued skill set.",administration/ business/ construction/ engineering/ health services sector/ information technology/ public sector/ science.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Fundamentals of Project Management,Project Planning and Control,Project Governance,Project Management and People,Art and Practice of Leadership,Work and Organisation Systems,Managing Innovation and Entrepreneurship,Organisation Change Management,Project Program and Portfolio Management,Project Management Practice,"This unit comprises three modules. In Module 1, participants will identify the roles of players and stakeholders engaged in specific projects and the interactions between them. Project management processes will be considered at both theoretical and applied levels (using authentic industry-based scenarios drawing on students' existing knowledge and experience). In Module 2, participants will study project initiation, development of a project charter, scoping and network analysis, time management, cost management and quality management. In Module 3 participants will work collaboratively within a simulated project environment and investigate the impact of human behaviour and group dynamics in project management. A key feature of the unit is the critique of the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge) framework.","The Project Planning and Control unit will review the development process of a project from its inception through to feasibility and commencement. Design documentation, procurement commissioning and life cycle planning will all be addressed. Theoretical frameworks for planning and managing the project management process will be critiqued. Project control and cost planning, financial control, time management and other scheduling techniques will be applied to practical scenarios.",Project management applies those technical and human skills that lead to project success. Project governance is the system and framework that ensures project decisions are made in alignment with the organisational governance policies and procedures. This unit of study will allow students to identify and develop processes through which a project governance framework can be set up and applied to projects in any organisation. This will involve a practical application of the principles on a project where the project governance framework is analysed for its ability to prevent project failure.,"Successful projects comprise several key features. One is the 'people' factor. Good project outcomes rely on both strong leadership and management skills which include the explicit specification and understanding of requisite roles, responsibilities, skills and effort of project participants. Project Management and People identifies and critically assesses the qualities of people working on projects and extrapolates how they can contribute to project success in a diversity of known and uncertain contexts. The subject also explores how human behaviour in project-focused organisations differs from that in more traditional organisational forms. The evidence base of theoretical and translational approaches to people management is reviewed and critiqued.","Uncertainty and changes call for unique leadership in businesses. The core learning in this unit is to understand the development of leadership capacity and prepare for critical transformation or transition in complex situations. A unique learning model that aims for students to increase to close the gap between their understanding and effective leadership action. The unit examines the contextual challenges facing leaders today, seeking to develop a deep personal understanding of leadership as a complex process of scanning the environment and setting the direction, and achieving organisational goals through influencing people both inside and outside the organisation. The dynamics of interpersonal power are investigated, with particular attention given to the leader as a social architect, implicit in the concepts of transformational and values-based authentic leadership.","This unit examines the major organisational system issues that managers need to understand and respond to in the context of significant changes in the world. These issues are considered in terms of the interaction between people and the organisational context within which they work. The unit emphasizes two approaches. First, to gain knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and organisational systems/structures through applied learning opportunities and, in the process, learn how to be a more effective leader and manager. Fundamental concepts about organisations, individuals and groups in relation to leadership and management are themes included. Second, because reflective practice is at the heart of critical thinking, students will be asked to take a critical approach to their practice, and the context in which they work.","This unit investigates theoretical concepts of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship and the skills and competencies to apply this knowledge effectively to diagnoses the need for, identify and leverage an opportunity and create solutions to contemporary business or societal challenges both locally and globally. The unit provides an authentic and evidence based learning experience of the study of the concepts of creativity, innovation, intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship in which learners engage and apply to planning, strategizing and decision making in professional, commercial and social contexts. The unit stimulates students to challenge the way in which entrepreneurs grow within, flourish and are perceived by and contribute to diverse societal contexts and to interpret this understanding to analysing and critiquing contemporary international entrepreneurial trends and dilemmas as responsible ethical and global citizens. Important paradoxes are posed for students to express the way in which human ingenuity translates to business endeavour which can have both positive and negative consequences individuals, societies and nations. Contemporary scenarios and examples are given to enable students to apply developing knowledge to create an entrepreneurial venture that generates economic, social or environmental benefit and which is sustainable.","This unit develops contemporary understanding of organisational design, organisational change and development through contextualisation of common challenges for change in both traditional and new organisational forms. Students are challenged through interrogation and critical reflection on practices and theories of critical and conventional theories and models of change. Students will advance their diagnostic skills, competencies and processes in assessing the need for change, and the development, implementation, and evaluation of change strategies at all organisational levels. Solutions to complex change management problems will be derived in a socially and culturally responsible manner, where students will advocate and substantiate recommendations grounded in scholarly literature to demonstrate professional responsibility and accountability.","Project, Program and Portfolio Management (PPPM) will introduce students to senior management decision-making models. Portfolio management involves prioritisation, risk assessment and deployment of resources across an entire organisation to achieve benefits to the whole-of-business. In contrast, program management identifies benefits and realises outcomes across programs and projects. PPPM concentrates on the development of a realistic picture of an organisation's business and future strategy and how to best use company resources to achieve beneficial results. These resources include adopting standards across an enterprise, developing staff competency through education and training, and implementing reporting regimes to provide senior management with information for sound decision making. Program Management feeds into portfolio decision making by providing accurate and real-time data, quality assurance across programs and projects and ensuring consistent processes are maintained.","This unit is designed to provide an understanding of the principles of project management practice and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and others in a project team. Utilising the PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge). Guide as a reference, the unit explores 10 Knowledge Areas in project management and instigates the process of applying these to contemporary and emerging project environments. The unit delivers a comprehensive understanding of how due diligence manifests in a project life cycle. It addresses what is to be delivered in a project (scope), how it is to be delivered (plan), the delivery and implementation (execution) and finally reporting and review. Theoretical models are proposed which integrate sustainable methods into the fabric of projects and operations and align project and business outcomes with organisational strategic goals.","1.

Osteopathic manual techniques for the upper extremity are explored in this unit with students being able to commence their manual therapy skills.,"Clinical Skills 2 introduces students to the osteopathic manual techniques, clinical examination and medical tests relevant to the lower limb. Students are able to further develop their patient communication and history taking skills by taking a systems history in addition to the presenting complaint for the lower limb. Clinical reasoning is a focus of this unit and students are encouraged to start to articulate their clinical thinking in relation to lower limb conditions.","This unit aims to build in students a readiness to communicate evidence and opinions clearly in professional settings. The unit serves to clarify the expectations held regarding communication in academia and the professional world, with a focus on the specific standards applied in the disciplines and professions associated with distinct courses. It builds in students the foundational knowledge and skills needed to begin to meet those expectations. Two axes of communication are explored: unilateral communication (e.g. speech, presentation, memo, executive summary) and interactive communication (e.g. interview, committee meeting, correspondence chain, social media thread). In all cases, a primary focus is on the meeting of expectations held by the receivers of the communication. As well as offering practical support for later academic assessment, the unit also develops skills needed in senior-years practical and industry project units, as well as in other forms of community and professional engagement.","This unit aims to demystify research and to build in students the confidence needed to use evidence with purpose. The unit will help students to understand what research is, to find relevant research products, and to consume and evaluate those products. Students will build foundational knowledge regarding discipline-based and professional contexts (as they relate to distinct course cohorts) in which research is produced and used (e.g. the evidence based practice paradigm as it applies to the health professions). Students will also build skills related to the sourcing, summary, and citing of literature. Students will be supported as they start to apply their knowledge and skills in order to communicate evidence to their peers. In doing so, the unit will enhance students' capacity and confidence to successfully use evidence in their academic and professional work.","Biomedical Science for Osteopathy 5 expands the students' knowledge of biomedical sciences through application of fundamental principles to the head and spine. Patients presenting in osteopathic practice tend to seek care for spine related pain and dysfunction, so a key focus in this unit is the anatomy and biomechanics of the head, neck and lumbar spine that can be related to osteopathic treatment principles. Students are able to strengthen their knowledge of  the clinical presentation of common musculoskeletal conditions affecting the head, neck and lower back.","Biomedical Science for Osteopathy 6 expands the students' knowledge of biomedical sciences through application of fundamental principles to the brain, cranial nerves and spinal cord.

Through debating contemporary issues this unit also assists students to develop a personal and professional philosophy about sport and active recreation service delivery.","This unit introduces students to the broad social, historical and cultural contexts in which sport and active recreation takes place. Research findings and theoretical concepts from history, sociology and cultural studies are used to help explain why some groups and individuals are excluded from, or marginalised through sport and active recreation. Students will undertake a series of learning activities which will enable them to identify and critique sport and recreation participation data and to deconstruct some common myths about Australian society. This unit also provides foundational knowledge and skills required in other units in the Sport Management courses.","This unit provides students with an understanding of communities and the role of sport and recreation in developing inclusive communities in today's changing society.

This unit will support students in their transition to University, engage students in student centred learning within group experiential activities and provide a challenge to students in an integrated activity that introduces other first year units. The unit aims to develop skills that are necessary for professional, personal and academic learning.

The challenge project will provide challenge, flexibility and model a real world business context. It will feature both individual and team activities within a professional business framework. 
Learning activities will be scaffolded to include team dynamics and conflict management, critical thinking and information analysis, academic skill formation with both written and presentation business communications. Learning activities will develop reflective writing on team formation and management of team conflict, peer review of the team component of the challenge task, team based report and various presentation styles and formats, online group collaboration review and academic writing and referencing assessment.","The aim of this unit is to provide students with an understanding of organisational behaviour and management theory; to assess critically the underlying values of these theories; to assess critically the utility and application of the management practices informed by these theories in the Australian context; and to analyse critically the values of Australian managers concerning behaviour in organisations and to evaluate the effectiveness of these assumptions. This unit includes the following topics: overview of the development of organisation/management theory; analysis of scientific management, human relations theory; individual behaviour/perception, personality, learning, motivation; group behaviour: group dynamics, conflict resolution, leadership, concentrating on Australian case studies and incorporating a consideration of issues of gender, ethnicity and age; applications of management/organisation theory in Australia; communication processes, and quality of working life.","This unit introduces students to the breadth of sport and active recreation in Australia. It contributes to an understanding of definitions, theories and principles specific to the sport and active recreation industry through coursework, research and reflection. It creates a foundation of knowledge for future professionals and for success in further units of study. Students gain an understanding of the structure and role of government, community organisations and businesses in sport and recreation service delivery. Through debating contemporary issues this unit also assists students to develop a personal and professional philosophy about sport and active recreation service delivery.","This unit introduces students to the broad social, historical and cultural contexts in which sport and active recreation takes place. Research findings and theoretical concepts from history, sociology and cultural studies are used to help explain why some groups and individuals are excluded from, or marginalised through sport and active recreation. Students will undertake a series of learning activities which will enable them to identify and critique sport and recreation participation data and to deconstruct some common myths about Australian society. This unit also provides foundational knowledge and skills required in other units in the Sport Management courses.","The objectives of the unit are to provide a basis for further accounting studies, yet meet the needs of students from other areas of business studies; to introduce students to basic accounting concepts and selected accounting practices; and to introduce students to the role of, and the processes involved in, planning and decision making within the business environment. Students will examine the roles of accounting and management planning for substantiating organisational decision making. To undertake this examination, students will synthesise principles and key professional practices of: accounting concepts; cash and accrual accounting; preparation of financial statements; forms of business ownership, and effect on financial statements. Following an introduction to budgeting, students will critically assess: the use of budgets for control and performance reports; analysis and interpretation; evaluation of performance; the operating cycle; and short term decision making and cost behaviour.","This unit introduces students to the fundamental concepts, issues and benefits of information systems to organisations and individuals. Students investigate the nature and types of information systems, their impact on business processes, and how these systems and processes contribute towards an organisations competitive advantage. The unit commences by examining the characteristics of good information and how it supports sound decision making.

The understandings and skills gained in this unit will assist students in their Career and Professional Development units, industry placements and workforce employment.","This unit is designed to prepare students for studies in Business with appropriate basic knowledge, skills and understanding so that they become familiar with terminology and statistical concepts, and are able to apply these at an elementary level. Furthermore, students completing the unit successfully will be prepared for further statistical knowledge developed in the context of specialised electives. They will be familiar with statistical terminology and well prepared to develop specific statistical techniques at more advanced levels if required to do so. 

To this end, students will be encouraged to explore a broad range of techniques during each teaching session and will be trained to pinpoint a specific statistical method to analyse a given business problem. Students will be introduced to: the rationale to apply statistics to business decisions and describing economic data by applying appropriate statistical techniques. Topics include: probability and probability distributions; normal probability distribution; sampling distributions and parameter estimation; hypotheses testing; linear regression and correlation; time-series analysis and forecasting; index numbers. Use will be made of a statistical computer package. The successful completion of the unit will enable students to visualise the business world from a scientific and quantitative perspective and will equip students to minimise the risk of subjective decision.","Students will learn techniques to locate and apply relevant law to business-related contracts that they can subsequently apply in their working life to avoid common problems arising in business contractual relationships, This unit aims to provide students with an understanding and awareness of the basic principles of Contract Law, a familiarity with relevant case law and an introduction to the statutory provisions pertinent to the course. This Unit aims to provide students with a working knowledge and overview of the legal system and an understanding of legal reasoning as it applies to the analysis of contractual relationships.

Linear and angular kinematics and kinetics concepts will be learnt through guided project work that investigates (i) linear kinematics of sports match analysis, (ii) angular kinematics and projectile motion of sports movement technique, (iii) linear and angular kinetics of human impacts during locomotion and agile movements, and (iv) friction, work and energy associated with sports equipment.","The general aim of the unit is to give students an understanding of basic concepts in human physiology. The unit will comprise a description of basic cell structures and functions for generalised and specialised cells; outline co-ordinated body functions with specific applications to the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculo-skeletal, neural, alimentary and renal systems. In addition, basic concepts in organic metabolism and energy balance will be considered.","In this unit students apply their knowledge to demonstrate an understanding of the acute physiological responses to exercise, as well as the chronic physiological responses to exercise training. The unit examines: the calculation of work, power and energy expenditure; the metabolic supply of energy during exercise; and the physiological responses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular and endocrine systems to exercise. Students are introduced to practical aspects of exercise physiology through experiments and procedures in the exercise physiology laboratory. This unit is taught from a theoretical, practical and applied perspective to enhance students' understanding of exercise physiology principles.","Sport and exercise professionals are increasingly recognising the importance of sport and exercise psychology in their work in an exercise/sport setting. This unit aims to help sport and exercise professionals understand the psychological factors that influence participation and performance in sport and exercise, and equip them with the fundamental skills needed to teach and apply interventions to promote and enhance the knowledge, participation, performance, growth and wellbeing of sport and exercise participants. Furthermore, this unit will encourage sport and exercise professionals to focus on their own self-awareness and professional growth.","This unit provides an introduction to nutrition for health, exercise and sports performance. It enables students to understand the roles of the main nutrient groups, as well as various vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements and ergogenic aids for the promotion of healthy living, prevention of chronic lifestyle-related diseases and enhancement of exercise and sport performance and recovery. Students study the influences of various diets and eating patterns on conditions such as overweight/obesity, and a diverse range of lifestyle disease. Students will understand the inter-relationships between nutrition and exercise in terms of energy balance, disordered eating and body composition assessment methods.","This unit aims to develop an integrated understanding of the process of motor learning and motor skill performance. The learning and performance of different motor skills, factors influencing motor learning, and the application of approaches to motor learning and motor skill performance will be explored to provide an appreciation of the theoretical, practical, and research features of motor learning.","1.

Furthermore, this unit will encourage sport and exercise professionals to focus on their own self-awareness and professional growth.","This unit introduces students to the broad social, historical and cultural contexts in which sport and active recreation takes place. Research findings and theoretical concepts from history, sociology and cultural studies are used to help explain why some groups and individuals are excluded from, or marginalised through sport and active recreation. Students will undertake a series of learning activities which will enable them to identify and critique sport and recreation participation data and to deconstruct some common myths about Australian society. This unit also provides foundational knowledge and skills required in other units in the Sport Management courses.","The aim of this unit is to provide students with an understanding of organisational behaviour and management theory; to assess critically the underlying values of these theories; to assess critically the utility and application of the management practices informed by these theories in the Australian context; and to analyse critically the values of Australian managers concerning behaviour in organisations and to evaluate the effectiveness of these assumptions. This unit includes the following topics: overview of the development of organisation/management theory; analysis of scientific management, human relations theory; individual behaviour/perception, personality, learning, motivation; group behaviour: group dynamics, conflict resolution, leadership, concentrating on Australian case studies and incorporating a consideration of issues of gender, ethnicity and age; applications of management/organisation theory in Australia; communication processes, and quality of working life.","The general aim of the unit is to give students an understanding of basic concepts in human physiology. The unit will comprise a description of basic cell structures and functions for generalised and specialised cells; outline co-ordinated body functions with specific applications to the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculo-skeletal, neural, alimentary and renal systems. In addition, basic concepts in organic metabolism and energy balance will be considered.","In this unit students apply their knowledge to demonstrate an understanding of the acute physiological responses to exercise, as well as the chronic physiological responses to exercise training. The unit examines: the calculation of work, power and energy expenditure; the metabolic supply of energy during exercise; and the physiological responses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular and endocrine systems to exercise. Students are introduced to practical aspects of exercise physiology through experiments and procedures in the exercise physiology laboratory. This unit is taught from a theoretical, practical and applied perspective to enhance students' understanding of exercise physiology principles.","This unit introduces students to biomechanical concepts and relatedness to common real-world issues in field of sports and exercise. Students will learn the biomechanics terminology, fundamental problem solving and analysis techniques, and major theories. Linear and angular kinematics and kinetics concepts will be learnt through guided project work that investigates (i) linear kinematics of sports match analysis, (ii) angular kinematics and projectile motion of sports movement technique, (iii) linear and angular kinetics of human impacts during locomotion and agile movements, and (iv) friction, work and energy associated with sports equipment.","This unit provides an introduction to the marketing function of the organisation. Identifying and meeting the needs of clients and customer groups is critical to achieving organisational goals. This unit of study provides an overview of the theories and principles of marketing which are supported by marketing science. The focus is on how organisations identify the needs of their target markets, understand the buying behaviour of their target markets, and develop a marketing mix to satisfy the needs and wants of these markets. While the course has a theoretical base that is underpinned by a marketing science approach, practical application of the concepts of marketing science is an essential element.","This unit introduces students to the principles and practice of financial management and financial planning, and their application to the administration of Australian sport and active recreation organisations. The financial management section focuses on balance sheets, income and expenditure statements, and cash flow statements. Special attention is given to financial performance, and how financial ratios, impact statements and cost-benefit analysis can be used to diagnose the financial health of sport and active recreation organisations, events, tournaments and programs. The planning section focuses on the pricing and budget processes, and the use of feasibility studies. It introduces students to the budgeting process, and examines the ways in which pricing strategies can be used to sustain revenues. It also discusses the issue of financial forecasting, and how future revenues, expenses, and operating surpluses can be estimated and monitored. Class activities centre on case studies of sport and active recreation organisations, and experiential exercises.","This unit includes the identification of the major structures of the skeletal, muscular, joints, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory systems and examination of their functions; developing the student's ability to link function to structure.

In our youth work degree, you'll learn to help young people develop through activities that are enjoyable, challenging and educational. You'll graduate with:",local government/ schools/ rehabilitation/ juvenile justice centre/ not-for-profit and community organisations.,Australia,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Yes,,Youth Work Practice,Youth Work Practice 2,Young People in a Global Community,Aboriginal History and Political Movements,Applied Human Rights,Principles of Youth Participation,Youth and Community Contexts,Youth and Community Programs,Ethics and Youth Work Practice,Holistic Practice With Young People,"This unit aims to provide a structural foundation for understanding the development and the dynamics of youth work. It will explore the evolution of youth work within a sociological and cultural framework that discusses the links between health, agency and empowerment, as well as a diverse range of youth work models that support and inform reflexive practitioners. Topics to be covered include the following: concepts of youth: historic and global development of the role of adolescence and the development of specific youth work practices; social, cultural and biological constructs of adolescence; social determinants of health in relation to resilience, risk and protective factors; constructs of marginalisation and disadvantage; identity, agency and empowerment; case studies of significant people who are agents of social change; models of youth work practice - treatment, reform, advocacy; settings and context of youth work.","This unit begins by looking at a definition of 'youth' and explains the importance of understanding the concept of adolescence and youth. It discusses the meaning and different concepts of adolescent welfare and wellbeing and describes the contemporary socio-economic and political context of adolescent welfare. 

This unit provides a definition of 'youth' as determined socially and culturally, as well as biologically whereby adolescent welfare is defined as socially constructed as well as a physical phenomenon that is integrated with social structures and processes. Using this integration of social structures and processes with the physiological challenges of adolescence this unit will canvass the range of adolescent issues that are prevalent today.","This unit identifies young people as global citizens and considers their transitions to adulthood in the context of culture, socio economic status, family, education and employment. The unit will explore and apply theories in sociology to consider the impact of globalisation, global structures and current trends on young people in the global community. It is particularly important for practitioners across the youth work, community development, and criminal justice sectors, who will be working with young people in the context of globalisation and growing interdependence.","This unit of study will be an introduction to the history of the Aboriginal struggle and the continual impact of colonisation upon Aboriginal Australian peoples. Students will explore the role of Aboriginal activism, including why Indigenous peoples have and continue to resist. Students will take part in a wide variety of activities in which they will be expected to engage in critical reflection and reading, and discussions.","This unit introduces students to human rights frameworks, theories, and practices, and the ways these operate in diverse social and cultural contexts. The unit outlines the history and development of human rights, including  international and national frameworks. Students will explore human rights practice through case study examples of a range of human rights issues, violations, and responses.","In this unit students develop a theoretical framework of practice, which reflects the key principles of youth participation, to enable young people to have a role, identity and voice in every community. Students learn to identify appropriate theories that assist them to understand the systemic barriers young people face and to develop strategies to assist young people to overcome these barriers. Investigating the various participation models informs practice and enables students to use and apply that knowledge in a range of settings within State, National and International Organisations. Adapting experiential processes to engage young people is also a central component of effective youth participation.","Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary scenarios relevant to the community, youth and justice sectors. Utilising a project-based approach students will complete a professional style report on a chosen scenario. This unit will begin the process of developing key academic and professional skills. Students will select a scenario, describe the background and context, identify and analyse the key issues, and propose appropriate responses. The knowledge and skills developed in this unit will prepare students for work in a range of youth and community contexts and work environments.","Youth Workers and Community Development Workers are expected to develop and implement a range of youth and community programs that are underpinned by practices that use informal and applied learning approaches to build robust programs. In this unit, students develop knowledge and understanding of the nature of experiential learning and non-formal education as tools to engage and re-engage at-risk people. Topics covered include: using experiential learning practices to work in youth and community settings; understanding attitudinal and motivational factors in learning; engaging and building connections with  people, including considering the diversity of learners and their learning. Throughout the unit, students review and critique a range of theoretical learning models which are underpinned by experiential learning theory and practice in order to gain skills and competencies for working effectively with people. Students then link this understanding to the building of programs.","This unit focuses on developing ethical approaches to all aspects of youth work in Australia and internationally. From an initial examination of the personal values and beliefs that shape individual practice, students are encouraged to analyse, evaluate and develop a framework for professional youth work practice. Knowledge of Human Rights and applying the YACVic Code of ethics to practice will enable students to integrate and embed an ethical approach to their work. This unit will also include the principles of youth work practice, aspects of professional conduct, and communication standards.","This unit introduces students to the theoretical and practical frameworks used to effectively understand the role of practitioners working with young people in supporting and referring young people with social, health and wellbeing issues. The unit aims to ensure good practice in relation to youth workers acting as referral points and working collaboratively with specialist practitioners. Youth workers work from a strengths-based framework of practice and as such, students consider various strategies to use while working with young people who present with various forms of wellbeing issues including, bullying, challenging behaviours and other causal circumstances such as homelessness. This is primarily a practice unit to enable students to understand the parameters of their professional ethical practice, identify strengths-based practice, and learn how to utilise complementary practitioners to ensure the holistic health and wellbeing of young people.","1.
